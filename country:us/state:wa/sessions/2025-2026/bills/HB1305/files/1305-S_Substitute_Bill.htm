The owner must submit a request for a contract to the municipality prior to approval of the water or sewer facility by the municipality. The owner's request may only require a contract under this subsection (1)(a) in locations where a municipality's ordinances require the facilities to be improved or constructed as a prerequisite to further property development. Water or sewer facilities improved or constructed in accordance with this subsection (1)(a) must be located within the municipality's corporate limits or, except as provided otherwise by this subsection (1)(a), within ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ten</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10</span> miles of the municipality's corporate limits. Water or sewer facilities improved or constructed in accordance with this subsection (1)(a) may not be located outside of the county that is party to the contract. The contract must be filed and recorded with the county auditor and must contain conditions required by the municipality in accordance with its adopted policies and standards. Unless the municipality provides written notice to the owner of its intent to request a comprehensive plan approval, the owner must request a comprehensive plan approval for a water or sewer facility, if required, and connection of the water or sewer facility to the municipal system must be conditioned upon:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Construction of the water or sewer facility according to plans and specifications approved by the municipality;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Inspection and approval of the water or sewer facility by the municipality;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Transfer to the municipality of the water or sewer facility, without cost to the municipality, upon acceptance by the municipality of the water or sewer facility;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Full compliance with the owner's obligations under the contract and with the municipality's rules and regulations;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Provision of sufficient security to the municipality to ensure completion of the water or sewer facility and other performance under the contract;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) Payment by the owner to the municipality of all of the municipality's costs associated with the water or sewer facility including, but not limited to, engineering, legal, and administrative costs; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) Verification and approval of all contracts and costs related to the water or sewer facility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) If authorized by ordinance or contract, a municipality may participate in financing water or sewer facilities development projects authorized and improved or constructed in accordance with (a) of this subsection. Unless otherwise provided by ordinance or contract, municipalities that participate in the financing of water or sewer facilities improved or constructed in accordance with (a) of this subsection:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Have the same rights to reimbursement as owners of real estate who make contributions as authorized under this section; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Are entitled to a pro rata share of the reimbursement based on the respective contribution of the owner and the municipality.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A contract entered into under this section must also provide, in accordance with the requirements of this section, for the pro rata reimbursement to the owner or the owner's assigns for ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">20</span> years, or for a longer period if extended in accordance with subsection (4) of this section. The reimbursements must be: (a) Within the period of time that the contract is effective; (b) for a portion of the costs of the water or sewer facilities improved or constructed in accordance with the contract; and (c) from latecomer fees received by the municipality from property owners who subsequently connect to or use the water or sewer facilities, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Except as provided otherwise by this section, a municipality seeking reimbursement from an owner of real estate under this section is limited to the dollar amount authorized in accordance with subsection (7) of this section.

This information must be used by the municipality as the basis for determining reimbursements by future users who benefit from the water or sewer facility, but who did not contribute to the original cost of the water or sewer facility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) Nothing in this section is intended to create a private right of action for damages against a municipality for failing to comply with the requirements of this section. A municipality, its officials, employees, or agents may not be held liable for failure to collect a latecomer fee unless the failure was willful or intentional. Failure of a municipality to comply with the requirements of this section does not relieve a municipality of any future requirement to comply with this section.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.72.020'>35.72.020</a> and 2006 c 88 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, the contract may provide for the partial reimbursement to the owner or the owner's assigns for a period not to exceed ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">fifteen</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">20</span> years of a portion of the costs of the project by other property owners who:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Are determined to be within the assessment reimbursement area pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.72.040'>35.72.040</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Are determined to have a reimbursement share based upon a benefit to the property owner pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.72.030'>35.72.030</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Did not contribute to the original cost of the street project; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Subsequently develop their property within the period of time that the contract is effective and at the time of development were not required to install similar street projects because they were already provided for by the contract.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Street projects subject to reimbursement may include design, grading, paving, installation of curbs, gutters, storm drainage, sidewalks, street lighting, traffic controls, and other similar improvements, as required by the street standards of the city, town, or county.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) The contract may provide for ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">an extension</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">one or more extensions</span> of the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">fifteen</span>-<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">year</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">20-year</span> reimbursement period<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, each</span> for a time not to exceed the duration of any moratorium, phasing ordinance, concurrency designation, or other governmental action that prevents making applications for, or the approval of, any new development within the benefit area for a period of six months or more.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For those contracts approved prior to February 29, 2020, an extension equal to the time between February 29, 2020, and October 28, 2022, during which the state of Washington was under a state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, shall be granted provided a request for this extension is received by the district prior to March 31, 2026.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c)</span> Upon the extension of the reimbursement period pursuant to (a) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or (b)</span> of this subsection, the contract must specify the duration of the contract extension and must be filed and recorded with the county auditor.
