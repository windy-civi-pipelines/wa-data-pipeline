By December 1, 2018, the superintendent shall review and revise the rules to achieve full and complete implementation of the requirements of this subsection and subsection (4) of this section including revisions to rules that provide additional flexibility to access community impact awards. Before revising any standards, procedures, or rules, the superintendent shall consult with the office of financial management and the fiscal committees of the legislature. In adopting and revising the rules, the superintendent shall ensure the application process to access safety net funding is streamlined, timelines for submission are not in conflict, feedback to school districts is timely and provides sufficient information to allow school districts to understand how to correct any deficiencies in a safety net application, and that there is consistency between awards approved by school district and by application period. The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall also provide technical assistance to school districts in preparing and submitting special education safety net applications.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4)(a) On an annual basis, the superintendent shall survey districts regarding their satisfaction with the safety net process and consider feedback from districts to improve the safety net process. Each year by December 1st, the superintendent shall prepare and submit a report to the office of financial management and the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature that summarizes the survey results and those changes made to the safety net process as a result of the school district feedback.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) By December 1, 2024, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must develop a survey requesting specific feedback on the safety net application process from school districts with 3,000 or fewer students. The survey must include, at a minimum, questions regarding the average amount of time school district staff spend gathering safety net application data, filling out application forms, and correcting application deficiencies. The survey must also include questions to help identify which application components are the most challenging and time consuming for school districts to complete. By December 1, 2025, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must use this feedback to implement a simplified, standardized safety net application for all school districts that reduces barriers to safety net funding.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The safety net oversight committee appointed by the superintendent of public instruction shall consist of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) One staff member from the office of the superintendent of public instruction;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Staff of the office of the state auditor who shall be nonvoting members of the committee; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) One or more representatives from school districts or educational service districts knowledgeable of special education programs and funding.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6)((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(a)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must distribute safety net awards to school districts on a quarterly basis if the following criteria are met:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) The safety net award is provided for a high cost student who receives special education services from an authorized entity, as defined under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.300.690'>28A.300.690</a>, located outside of the state of Washington;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) The school district successfully applied for and received a safety net award for the high cost student in a prior school year and the student's placement has not changed since that safety net award was granted; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) The school district meets all other safety net award eligibility requirements as determined by the safety net oversight committee.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(7) Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, the office of the superintendent of public instruction must distribute safety net awards to second-class school districts on a quarterly basis.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(8)</span> Beginning in the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2019-20</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2025-26</span> school year, a high-need student is eligible for safety net awards from state funding under subsection (2)(e) and ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(g)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(f)</span> of this section ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">if the student's individualized education program costs exceed two and three-tenths times the average per-pupil expenditure as defined in Title 20 U.S.C.
