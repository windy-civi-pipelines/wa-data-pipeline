These risks may harm both students and the taxpayers in students' home states. The Washington state attorney general, along with the attorneys general of 24 other states and the District of Columbia, have urged the national council for the state authorization reciprocity agreement to reform the standards of state authorization reciprocity agreements. The national council for state authorization reciprocity agreements is not directly accountable to participating states and has had significant potential for conflict of interest.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->According to the joint letter from the offices of the attorneys general, the national council for state authorization reciprocity agreements' current policies "do not adequately guard against the unique risks that arise from distance learning. For instance, NC-SARA's policy prohibiting member states from enforcing education-specific consumer protection laws against out-of-state NC-SARA participating schools undermines our Offices' and other state agencies' ability to protect students in our states. It also creates a two-tiered system of protection, in which students attending NC-SARA-participating schools receive the benefit of fewer consumer protection laws than students attending schools based in our state or attending schools that do not participate in NC-SARA. This incentivizes NC-SARA participating schools to locate in states with weaker education-specific consumer protection laws, such as financial protections in the event of unanticipated closure, to avoid having to comply with more student-protective laws. Our conversations with some of the representatives of state entities that enforce NC-SARA rules showed that they share this concern."</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that Washington has led the western interstate commission for higher education to adopt proposed reforms to state authorization reciprocity agreements and intends to encourage the student achievement council and the western interstate commission for higher education to continue this effort through this act. It is the objective of the legislature to ensure that the state authorization reciprocity agreement is reformed to recognize that student consumer protections adopted through legislation or rule in Washington protect all students residing in Washington through the adoption of this act while providing institutions domiciled in Washington the benefits of reciprocal approval or authorization to offer programs in other states after meeting Washington's rigorous review and approval or authorization standards. </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature does not intend for this act to imply that the existing legislatively adopted student consumer protections do not provide protection to students in Washington while Washington engages in efforts to reform the state authorization reciprocity agreement.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.85.020'>28B.85.020</a> and 2013 c 218 s 3 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The council:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Shall adopt by rule, in accordance with chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05'>34.05</a> RCW, minimum standards for degree-granting institutions concerning granting of degrees, quality of education, unfair business practices, financial stability, and other necessary measures to protect citizens of this state against substandard, fraudulent, or deceptive practices.
