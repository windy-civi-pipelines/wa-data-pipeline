The northeast and southeast Washington habitat has mostly been occupied by wolves and as such, they are increasing their presence in the north and central Cascades and making an appearance in the south Cascades. State law currently requires a species to be likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future in order for the regulatory status of "threatened" to apply. The legislature finds that this definition does not fit the situation of the wolves at the effective date of this section. The legislature finds that "sensitive" species designation is the more appropriate regulatory status for wolves. The legislature finds that the "sensitive" status will protect wolves from unlawful take and harassment as well as preclude hunting because regulatory classification as a "sensitive" species requires cooperative management and removal of threats. The legislature also finds that this status must be reviewed in two years from the effective date of this section.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.12.020'>77.12.020</a> and 2014 c 202 s 302 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The director shall investigate the habits and distribution of the various species of wildlife native to or adaptable to the habitats of the state.

In accordance with the department of fish and wildlife's recommendation, the purpose of the change of classification to sensitive status is to continue to protect the wolves from unlawful take under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.15'>77.15</a> RCW, from malicious and intentional harassment, and from unlawful hunting, take, or harassment. While under the sensitive status designation, the department shall administer chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.12'>77.12</a> RCW to prohibit the hunting of wolves and make conservation of the species and their habitat a priority. Wolves would not be hunted and would remain on the list of priority habitats and species. The sensitive species designation must remain until the department of fish and wildlife's next proposed review. The species must not revert to endangered unless the population is shown to be vulnerable or declining below the population count as of the effective date of this section. </span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The director of the department of fish and wildlife must take the necessary steps on the effective date of this section to ensure that this act is implemented as soon as practicable.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
