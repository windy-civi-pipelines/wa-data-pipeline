This has, and continues to, disproportionately impact working-age mothers and contributes to the gender pay gap. The legislature recognizes that high quality, inclusive child care can reduce the opportunity gap for low-income children and black, indigenous, and children of color while consistently improving outcomes for all children both inside and outside of the classroom.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature acknowledges that in 2019, the Washington state child care collaborative task force found that 49 percent of parents in the state found it difficult or very difficult to find, afford, and keep child care. The lack of child care was projected to cost the state $2,080,000,000 in the direct cost of turnover and missed work due to child care issues, with a total estimate of $6,500,000,000 in direct and opportunity costs due to employee child care issues. The legislature further finds that for over the past decade, the trend has been in the wrong direction, between 2010 and 2023, the state has seen a decrease of 2,000 family child care providers and 300 centers, contributing to an increase in child care deserts statewide. Child care deserts are most often in communities that struggle with health and economic disparities. Not having access to affordable child care is a further detriment that perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature further finds that sustainably managed forests enhance carbon sequestration and reduce the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Sustainably managed forests can also provide a stream of revenue to support new and existing child care resources in the areas of greatest need in the state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Accordingly, the legislature intends to create a permanent children's social equity land trust that will utilize the trust management expertise of the department of natural resources to deliver much needed revenue for child care programs while prioritizing funding for child care deserts to assist families with access to child care where the need is greatest.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>(1) The department is authorized to locate and acquire by gift or by purchase forested lands suitable to manage for the purpose of revenue production.
