The legislature finds that protecting the accessibility of reproductive health care, end-of-life care, and gender-affirming care in communities across the state requires additional analysis and scrutiny. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that residents have access to these services in the communities in which they live. In order to provide communities, health care providers, and state regulators the information they need to ensure adequate access to these protected services, the legislature intends to update the statewide health resource strategy to specifically include ongoing analysis of the availability of these services. Additionally, the legislature intends to empower the department of health to scrutinize health care transactions that would directly affect access to care that is the subject of the reproductive privacy act, care that is the subject of the death with dignity act, and gender affirming health care. In considering the effect of health care transactions, the legislature is also aware that denial or delay of such transactions may lead to health care service disruption or loss of critically important community health care services including hospital care, emergency care, specialty care, primary care, obstetric care, or other services. The legislature intends that regulation of such transactions by the department in order to protect access to these sensitive health care services is additive and complementary to the existing powers given to the attorney general to review transactions for anticompetitive conduct and consumer harm.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
