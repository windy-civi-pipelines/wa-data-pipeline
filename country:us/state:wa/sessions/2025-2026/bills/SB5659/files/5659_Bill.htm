By some estimates, our state needs more than 1,000,000 new homes. While many policy proposals have been offered in good faith as solutions to the housing shortage, the stubborn truth is that Washington simply needs to build more housing.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Local governments will play a key role in eliminating Washington's housing shortage because local governments usually exercise approval authority over new home construction. Additionally, the legislature recognizes that some state laws may constrain local governments' ability to approve construction of new housing. Both levels of government should work together to create public policies that help build more homes in Washington.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature intends to encourage local and state government to promote the construction of new homes and end the housing shortage over the next 10 years.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) Every county, city, and town, that has authority to approve or deny permits or other similar approvals necessary for the construction of new homes shall approve the construction of enough new homes to eliminate the county, city, or town's proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage, as calculated under subsection (2) of this section, through 2035.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The department of commerce shall establish each county, city, and town's proportional share of Washington's total housing shortage using the best available data.
