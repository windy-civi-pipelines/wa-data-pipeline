With abundant wealth concentrated in specific sectors and among particular companies and individuals, there is a need to prioritize and direct financial resources to those most vulnerable in need of health care. Washingtonians depend on our nonprofit hospitals to care for our loved ones during their greatest times of need.<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that some nonprofit hospitals find themselves with large revenues and inflated administrative salaries but fail to fulfill their fundamental responsibilities to the communities they are meant to serve. This neglect of their duties, including failure to offer essential reproductive health services, provide safe working conditions to frontline staff, and care for our most vulnerable populations, while simultaneously engaging in excessive compensation of top earners, erodes trust in the health care system.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature intends to expand access to affordable health care by controlling health care administrative costs through a tax on excess compensation paid by hospitals. This additional revenue will provide funding to increase Washingtonians' access to health care, including funding programs that advance health equity and expand access to reproductive care.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>DEFINITIONS.The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Annual total compensation" means the total compensation of a covered employee as required to be reported to the department of health under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.70.052'>43.70.052</a>(3).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Average annual wage" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50.04.355'>50.04.355</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Covered employees" means the five highest compensated employees of a hospital, who do not have any direct patient responsibilities, and for whom the hospital must report compensation under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.70.052'>43.70.052</a>(3).
