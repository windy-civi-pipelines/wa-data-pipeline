The standard must include energy use intensity targets by building type and methods of conditional compliance that include an energy management plan, operations and maintenance program, energy efficiency audits, and investment in energy efficiency measures designed to meet the targets. The department shall use ANSI/ASHRAE/IES standard 100-2018 as an initial model for standard development. The department must update the standard by July 1, 2029, and every five years thereafter. Prior to the adoption or update of the standard, the department must identify the sources of information it relied upon, including peer-reviewed science.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) In establishing the standard under subsection (1) of this section, the department:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Must develop energy use intensity targets that are no greater than the average energy use intensity for the covered commercial building occupancy type with adjustments for unique energy using features. The department must also develop energy use intensity targets for additional property types eligible for incentives in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.27A.220'>19.27A.220</a>. The department must consider regional and local building energy utilization data, such as existing energy star benchmarking data, in establishing targets for the standard. Energy use intensity targets must be developed for two or more climate zones and be representative of energy use in a normal weather year;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) May consider building occupancy classifications from ANSI/ASHRAE/IES standard 100-2018 and the United States environmental protection agency's energy star portfolio manager when developing energy use intensity targets;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) May implement lower energy use intensity targets for more recently built covered commercial buildings based on the state energy code in place when the buildings were constructed;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d)(i) Must adopt a conditional compliance method that ensures that covered commercial buildings that do not meet the specified energy use intensity targets are taking action to achieve reduction in energy use, including investment criteria for conditional compliance that ensure that energy efficiency measures identified by energy audits are implemented to achieve a covered commercial building's energy use intensity target. The investment criteria must require that a building owner adopt an implementation plan to meet the energy intensity target or implement an optimized bundle of energy efficiency measures that provides maximum energy savings without resulting in a savings-to-investment ratio of less than 1.0, except as exempted in (d)(ii) of this subsection. The implementation plan must be based on an investment grade energy audit and a life-cycle cost analysis that accounts for the period during which a bundle of measures will provide savings. The building owner's cost for implementing energy efficiency measures must reflect net cost, excluding any costs covered by utility or government grants. The implementation plan may exclude measures that do not pay for themselves over the useful life of the measure and measures excluded under (d)(ii) of this subsection. The implementation plan may include phased implementation such that the building owner is not required to replace a system or equipment before the end of the system or equipment's useful life;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) For those buildings or structures that are listed in the state or national register of historic places; designated as a historic property under local or state designation law or survey; certified as a contributing resource with a national register listed or locally designated historic district; or with an opinion or certification that the property is eligible to be listed on the national or state registers of historic places either individually or as a contributing building to a historic district by the state historic preservation officer or the keeper of the national register of historic places, no individual energy efficiency requirement need be met that would compromise the historical integrity of a building or part of a building;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Must provide an alternative compliance pathway for an owner of a state campus district energy system, in accordance with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.27A.260'>19.27A.260</a>, and more broadly for the owner of any campus district energy system that is approved by the department to opt-in in accordance with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.27A.260'>19.27A.260</a>(6);</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Must guarantee that the owner of a state campus district energy system is not required to implement more than one energy management plan and more than one operations and maintenance plan for the campus;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Must guarantee that a state campus district energy system, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.27A.260'>19.27A.260</a>, and all buildings connected to a state campus district energy system, are in compliance with any requirements for campus buildings to implement energy efficiency measures identified by an energy audit if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The energy audit demonstrates the energy savings from the state campus district energy system energy efficiency measures will be greater than the energy efficiency measures identified for the campus buildings; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The state campus district energy system implements the energy efficiency measures.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Based on records obtained from each county assessor and other available information sources, the department must create a database of covered commercial buildings and building owners required to comply with the standard established in accordance with this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) By July 1, 2021, the department must provide the owners of covered buildings with notification of compliance requirements.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The department must develop a method for administering compliance reports from building owners.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The department must provide a customer support program to building owners including, but not limited to, outreach and informational material, periodic training, phone and email support, and other technical assistance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) The building owner of a covered commercial building must report the building owner's compliance with the standard to the department in accordance with the schedule established under subsection (8) of this section and every five years thereafter.
