The legislature further finds the minimum wage in some local jurisdictions surpasses that of the state and represents the highest of any cities in the United States.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature recognizes the importance of ensuring fair compensation for workers while balancing the broader economic impacts of wage and labor policies. The legislature acknowledges that increases in the minimum wage reflect efforts to address rising costs of living. However, the legislature also finds that recent aggressive increases in the minimum wage at both the state and local level also carry inflationary consequences, which can diminish the intended purchasing power benefits and impose unintended burdens on small businesses and consumers alike.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that while well-intentioned, these drastic wage hikes over a short time may actually hurt the very workers they were intended to benefit. As recent research from the University of Washington indicates, these increases have reduced available hours and cost workers potential earnings. The legislature recognizes that many small businesses operate on razor-thin margins and rapid shifts in the cost of labor jeopardize the ability of these businesses to remain open. Such policies may incentivize the exact opposite behavior that they were intended to generate, as employers facing higher costs may be forced to reduce hiring, cut hours, transition to increasingly available automation, or ultimately decide on layoffs as the only ways to remain in business. The legislature further finds that these unintended consequences have an enormous disproportionate impact on young workers seeking entry-level jobs, shutting young candidates out of their first employment opportunities and stifling their potential career growth.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature seeks to address the economic and social ramifications of the current volatile state and local minimum wage policies by pausing further shifts in the minimum wage and linking future increases to more stable and uniform federal action.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.46.020'>49.46.020</a> and 2019 c 236 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) Beginning ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">January 1, 2017, and until January 1, 2018, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees who has reached the age of eighteen years wages at a rate of not less than eleven dollars per hour.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(b) Beginning January 1, 2018, and until January 1, 2019, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees who has reached the age of eighteen years wages at a rate of not less than eleven dollars and fifty cents per hour.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(c) Beginning January 1, 2019, and until January 1, 2020, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees who has reached the age of eighteen years wages at a rate of not less than twelve dollars per hour.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(d) Beginning January 1, 2020, and until January 1, 2021, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees who has reached the age of eighteen years wages at a rate of not less than thirteen dollars and fifty cents per hour.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(2)(a) Beginning on January 1, 2021, and each following January 1st as set forth under (b) of this subsection, every employer shall pay to each of his or her employees who has reached the age of eighteen years wages at a rate of not less than the amount established under (b) of this subsection.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(b) On September 30, 2020, and on each following September 30th, the department of labor and industries shall calculate an adjusted minimum wage rate to maintain employee purchasing power by increasing the current year's minimum wage rate by the rate of inflation.
