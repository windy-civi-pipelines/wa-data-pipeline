The legislature finds that the statutes in chapter 58.17 RCW governing the subdivision of land were originally enacted in 1969. The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in implementation by local jurisdiction over 50 years such that a preliminary plat has the level of detail of what was previously considered for a final plat. The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of the growth management act, the statutes governing local project review in chapter 36.70B RCW, and the statutes integrating project review under the state environmental policy act and the growth management act. The submittal requirements for a short plat have evolved to become essentially the same as required for a subdivision making the distinction between a short plat and a subdivision obsolete. This act intends to update the statutes governing the division of land to provide a uniform process.Sec. 2. RCW 58.17.010 and 1981 c 293 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:The legislature finds that the process by which land is divided is a matter of state concern and should be administered in a uniform manner by cities, towns, and counties throughout the state. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the ((subdivision))division of land, alteration of property boundaries, and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare in accordance with standards established by the state ((to prevent the overcrowding of land;)) to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to promote ((effective))efficient use of land; ((to promote safe and convenient travel by the public on streets and highways;)) to provide for adequate light and air; to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and other public requirements; to provide for proper ingress and egress; to provide for the expeditious review and approval of proposed subdivisions which conform to ((zoning standards and local plans and policies))local comprehensive plans, zoning, and development regulations; to adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of the ((citizens))people of the state; and to require ((uniform monumenting of land subdivisions and conveyancing by accurate legal description))a uniform process for the division of land, and conveyances with accurate legal descriptions.Sec. 3. RCW 58.17.020 and 2002 c 262 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.(1) "Subdivision" is the division or redivision of land into ((five))two or more lots, tracts, parcels, sites, or divisions for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section.(2) "Plat" is a map or representation of a subdivision, showing thereon the division of a tract or parcel of land into lots, blocks, streets and alleys, or other divisions and dedications.(3) "Dedication" is the deliberate appropriation of land by an owner for any general and public uses, reserving to himself or herself no other rights than such as are compatible with the full exercise and enjoyment of the public uses to which the property has been ((devoted))dedicated.

((However, the legislative authority of any city or town may by local ordinance increase the number of lots, tracts, or parcels to be regulated as short subdivisions to a maximum of nine.

The legislature finds that the statutes in chapter 58.17 RCW governing the subdivision of land were originally enacted in 1969. The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in implementation by local jurisdiction over 50 years such that a preliminary plat has the level of detail of what was previously considered for a final plat. The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of the growth management act, the statutes governing local project review in chapter 36.70B RCW, and the statutes integrating project review under the state environmental policy act and the growth management act. The submittal requirements for a short plat have evolved to become essentially the same as required for a subdivision making the distinction between a short plat and a subdivision obsolete. This act intends to update the statutes governing the division of land to provide a uniform process.Sec. 2. RCW 58.17.010 and 1981 c 293 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:The legislature finds that the process by which land is divided is a matter of state concern and should be administered in a uniform manner by cities, towns, and counties throughout the state. The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the ((subdivision))division of land, alteration of property boundaries, and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare in accordance with standards established by the state ((to prevent the overcrowding of land;)) to lessen congestion in the streets and highways; to promote ((effective))efficient use of land; ((to promote safe and convenient travel by the public on streets and highways;)) to provide for adequate light and air; to facilitate adequate provision for water, sewerage, parks and recreation areas, sites for schools and schoolgrounds, and other public requirements; to provide for proper ingress and egress; to provide for the expeditious review and approval of proposed subdivisions which conform to ((zoning standards and local plans and policies))local comprehensive plans, zoning, and development regulations; to adequately provide for the housing and commercial needs of the ((citizens))people of the state; and to require ((uniform monumenting of land subdivisions and conveyancing by accurate legal description))a uniform process for the division of land, and conveyances with accurate legal descriptions.Sec. 3. RCW 58.17.020 and 2002 c 262 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:As used in this chapter, unless the context or subject matter clearly requires otherwise, the words or phrases defined in this section shall have the indicated meanings.(1) "Subdivision" is the division or redivision of land into ((five))two or more lots, tracts, parcels, sites, or divisions for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section.(2) "Plat" is a map or representation of a subdivision, showing thereon the division of a tract or parcel of land into lots, blocks, streets and alleys, or other divisions and dedications.(3) "Dedication" is the deliberate appropriation of land by an owner for any general and public uses, reserving to himself or herself no other rights than such as are compatible with the full exercise and enjoyment of the public uses to which the property has been ((devoted))dedicated.

The preliminary plat shall be the basis for the approval or disapproval of the general layout of a subdivision for which a complete application has been submitted for approval on or before June 30, 2026.(5) "Final plat" is the final drawing of the subdivision ((and dedication)) prepared for filing for record with the county auditor and containing all elements and requirements set forth in this chapter and in local regulations adopted under this chapter.(6) "Short subdivision" is the division or redivision of land into ((four))nine or fewer lots, tracts, parcels, ((sites, or divisions))or blocks for the purpose of sale, lease, or transfer of ownership for which a complete application has been submitted for approval on or before June 30, 2026. ((However, the legislative authority of any city or town may by local ordinance increase the number of lots, tracts, or parcels to be regulated as short subdivisions to a maximum of nine. The legislative authority of any county planning under RCW 36.70A.040 that has adopted a comprehensive plan and development regulations in compliance with chapter 36.70A RCW may by ordinance increase the number of lots, tracts, or parcels to be regulated as short subdivisions to a maximum of nine in any urban growth area.))(7) "Binding site plan" means a drawing to a scale specified by local ordinance which: (a) Identifies and shows the areas and locations of all streets, roads, improvements, utilities, open spaces, and any other matters specified by local development regulations; (b) contains inscriptions or attachments setting forth such appropriate limitations and conditions for the use of the land as are established by the ((local government body))city, town, or county having authority to approve the site plan; and (c) contains provisions making any development be in conformity with the site plan.(8) "Short plat" is the map or representation of a short subdivision for which a complete application is submitted for approval on or before June 30, 2026, and which is submitted for filing with the auditors of the counties in which the short subdivision is located.(9) "Lot" is a fractional part of divided lands having fixed boundaries, being of sufficient area and dimension to meet minimum zoning requirements for width and area.

RCW 58.17.033 and 1987 c 104 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Every subdivision of land must comply with the provisions of this chapter.(2) The legislative bodies of cities, towns, and counties have sole authority to enact or amend ordinances governing subdivisions and development regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter. The ordinance may delegate final plat approval to a planning commission or authorized official in accordance with state law or local charter.(3) A proposed division of land((, as defined in RCW 58.17.020,)) shall be considered under the applicable subdivision ((or short subdivision)) ordinance, ((and)) zoning ((or other land use control ordinances, in effect on the land at the time a fully completed application for preliminary plat approval of the subdivision, or short plat approval of the short subdivision, has been submitted to the appropriate county, city, or town official)), and other development regulations in effect at the time an application for plat approval of a subdivision is submitted to the authorized official and is deemed to be complete in accordance with RCW 36.70B.070.(((2)))(4) The requirements for a fully completed application shall be defined by local ordinance consistent with the requirements of chapter 36.70B RCW.

RCW 58.17.035 and 1987 c 354 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:((A city, town, or county may adopt by ordinance procedures for the divisions of land by use of a binding site plan as an alternative to the procedures required by this chapter. The ordinance shall be limited and only apply to one or more of the following: (1) The use of a binding site plan to divisions for sale or lease of commercially or industrially zoned property as provided in RCW 58.17.040(4); (2) divisions of property for lease as provided for in RCW 58.17.040(5); and (3) divisions of property as provided for in RCW 58.17.040(7). Such ordinance may apply the same or different requirements and procedures to each of the three types of divisions and shall provide for the alteration or vacation of the binding site plan, and may provide for the administrative approval of the binding site plan.The ordinance shall provide that after approval of the general binding site plan for industrial or commercial divisions subject to a binding site plan, the approval for improvements and finalization of specific individual commercial or industrial lots shall be done by administrative approval.The binding site plan, after approval, and/or when specific lots are administratively approved, shall be filed with the county auditor with a record of survey.
