The subdivision process as originally enacted has evolved in implementation by local jurisdiction over 50 years such that a preliminary plat has the level of detail of what was previously considered for a final plat. The subdivision statutes have not been comprehensively updated since the adoption of the growth management act, the statutes governing local project review in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70B'>36.70B</a> RCW, and the statutes integrating project review under the state environmental policy act and the growth management act.
