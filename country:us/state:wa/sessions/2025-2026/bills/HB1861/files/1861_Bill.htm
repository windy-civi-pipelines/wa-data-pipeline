To better protect children and families, it is necessary to allow them to make informed decisions about outdoor activities. This is especially important for those residing in low-income census tracts that experience disproportionately high impacts due to a higher concentration of young residents and fewer resources at their disposal to mitigate the harmful effects of exposure to damaging PM2.5, fine particulate matter, which poses significant health risks.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.5140'>70A.15.5140</a> and 2024 c 280 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department of natural resources, in granting burning permits for fires for the purposes set forth in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.5120'>70A.15.5120</a>, shall condition the issuance and use of such permits to comply to the extent feasible with air quality standards established by the department of ecology. Such burning shall not cause the state air quality standards to be exceeded in the ambient air up to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">two thousand</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2,000</span> feet above ground level over critical areas designated by the department of ecology, otherwise subject to air pollution from other sources. Air quality standards shall be established and published by the department of ecology which shall also establish a procedure for advising the department of natural resources when and where air contaminant levels exceed or threaten to exceed the ambient air standards over such critical areas. The air quality shall be quantitatively measured by the department of ecology or the appropriate local air pollution control authority at established monitoring stations over such designated areas. Further, such permitted burning shall not cause damage to public health or the environment. All permits issued under this section shall be subject to all applicable fees, permitting, penalty, and enforcement provisions of this chapter. The department of natural resources shall set forth smoke dispersal objectives designed consistent with this section to minimize any air pollution from such burning and the procedures necessary to meet those objectives.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) The department of natural resources shall encourage more intense utilization in logging and alternative silviculture practices to reduce the need for burning.
