The proceeds are deemed assigned in the same intervals and in the same amount for each interval as compensation was allocated under the contract.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Remuneration does not include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The payment of tips;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Supplemental benefit payments made by an employer to an employee in addition to any paid family or medical leave benefits received by the employee; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Payments to members of the armed forces of the United States, including the organized militia of the state of Washington, for the performance of duty for periods not exceeding seventy-two hours at a time.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(23)(a) "Serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any period of incapacity; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Continuing treatment by a health care provider. A serious health condition involving continuing treatment by a health care provider includes any one or more of the following:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(I) Treatment two or more times, within thirty days of the first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist, by a health care provider, by a nurse or physician's assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services, such as a physical therapist, under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(II) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(C) Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(I) Requires periodic visits, defined as at least twice a year, for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(II) Continues over an extended period of time, including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(III) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity, including asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or family member must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider, including Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(E) Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments, including any period of recovery from the treatments, by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for: (I) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or (II) a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as cancer, severe arthritis, or kidney disease.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The requirement in (a)(i) and (ii) of this subsection for treatment by a health care provider means an in-person visit to a health care provider. The first, or only, in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment is necessary within the thirty-day period shall be determined by the health care provider.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The term extenuating circumstances in (a)(ii)(A)(I) of this subsection means circumstances beyond the employee's control that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by the health care provider. Whether a given set of circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed within the thirty-day period, but the health care provider does not have any available appointments during that time period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Treatment for purposes of (a) of this subsection includes, but is not limited to, examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under (a)(ii)(A)(II) of this subsection, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, but is not limited to, a course of prescription medication, such as an antibiotic, or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition, such as oxygen. A regimen of continuing treatment that includes taking over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves, or bed rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of this title.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are administered, such as most treatments for acne or plastic surgery, are not serious health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraines, routine dental or orthodontia problems, and periodontal disease are examples of conditions that are not serious health conditions and do not qualify for leave under this title. Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions provided all the other conditions of this section are met. Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of this section are met.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g)(i) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this section are met. However, leave may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a licensed substance abuse treatment provider. Absence because of the employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for leave under this title.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an employer from taking employment action against an employee. The employer may not take action against the employee because the employee has exercised his or her right to take medical leave for treatment. However, if the employer has an established policy, applied in a nondiscriminatory manner that has been communicated to all employees, that provides under certain circumstances an employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the employee is presently taking medical leave. An employee may also take family leave to care for a covered family member who is receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employer may not take action against an employee who is providing care for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance abuse.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Absences attributable to incapacity under (a)(ii)(B) or (C) of this subsection qualify for leave under this title even though the employee or the family member does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee's health care provider has advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(24) "Service is localized in this state" has the same meaning as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50.04.120'>50.04.120</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(25) "Spouse" means a husband or wife, as the case may be, or state registered domestic partner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(26) "State average weekly wage" means the most recent average weekly wage calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50.04.355'>50.04.355</a> and available on January 1st of each year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(27) "Supplemental benefit payments" means payments made by an employer to an employee as salary continuation or as paid time off. Such payments must be in addition to any paid family or medical leave benefits the employee is receiving.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(28) "Typical workweek hours" means:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) For an hourly employee, the average number of hours worked per week by an employee within the qualifying period; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Forty hours for a salaried employee, regardless of the number of hours the salaried employee typically works.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(29) "Wage" or "wages" means:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) For the purpose of premium assessment, the remuneration paid by an employer to an employee. The maximum wages subject to a premium assessment are those wages as set by the commissioner under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50A.10.030'>50A.10.030</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) For the purpose of payment of benefits, the remuneration paid by one or more employers to an employee for employment during the employee's qualifying period. At the request of an employee, wages may be calculated on the basis of remuneration payable. The department shall notify each employee that wages are calculated on the basis of remuneration paid, but at the employee's request a redetermination may be performed and based on remuneration payable; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) For the purpose of a self-employed person electing coverage under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50A.10.010'>50A.10.010</a>, the meaning is defined by rule.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
