These promising results combined with the risk profile have led both Oregon and Colorado to legalize regulated psychedelic substance services for adults 21 years and older by ballot initiative;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Based on informed speculation, the benefits of therapeutic administration of psychedelic substances are likely to be particularly great when paired with clinical services of a trained therapist who can assist a person in preparing for, and integrating their experience with, psychedelic substances; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Despite a recent proliferation of studies, the federal government's classification of psychedelic substances as Schedule I controlled substances has stymied the creation of high quality large-scale research studies into their risks and benefits of psychedelic substances, to everyone's detriment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature enacts this act for a threefold purpose:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) To provide adults in Washington with a regulated, safe means of accessing psychedelic substances to be overseen by the department of health using fully tested substances administered by licensed professionals;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) To provide a safe harbor for health professionals interested in applying their clinical skills and new training to help clients maximize the therapeutic benefit from safe use of psychedelic substances while receiving protection from adverse licensure action within Washington state based on the federal prohibitions; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) To advance knowledge about the risks and benefits of the use of psychedelic substances by facilitating research opportunities in the state of Washington using clinical trials and by analysis of anonymized aggregate data that may not be used to identify an individual person without the person's consent.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The legislature finds that:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(a) Equity, access, and inclusion are important values to consider for participation in the regulated psychedelic substance system and participation as clients when the system is established;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) There is a special need for the potential benefits from therapeutic use of psychedelic substances among historically disadvantaged communities, economically disadvantaged communities, justice involved communities, and communities that have been disproportionately impacted by the war against drugs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Experience with legalization in Oregon and Colorado has shown that the highest barrier to participation in the psychedelic substance system is high cost, engendered in part by the unavailability of insurance coverage and the high cost of regulatory operations and regulatory compliance in this new industry;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) It is not possible to effectively address equity, access, and inclusion without addressing cost of services;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Consciousness of cost is not incompatible with prudent regard for the safety of psychedelic substance clients and the public; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) While well-designed regulations enhance safety and consumer confidence and promote reasonable and prudent precautions against diversion of psychedelic substances, overbearing regulation, however well-meaning, increases costs for licensees and clients.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Therefore, the legislature directs the department of health and the liquor and cannabis board to consider the cost and complexity of regulatory compliance when adopting regulations under this act, and to enact rules that maximize flexibility and lower costs for licensees and streamline the experience for clients as much as possible, considering the comparatively small street value and lack of toxicity of psychedelic substances, and maintaining due regard for client safety.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) Regulatory duties under this act are divided between:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(a) The department of health, which must oversee the licensure of facilitators, clinical facilitators, and service centers, and develop rules relating to preparation, administration, and integration sessions, including permissible locations for administration sessions;
