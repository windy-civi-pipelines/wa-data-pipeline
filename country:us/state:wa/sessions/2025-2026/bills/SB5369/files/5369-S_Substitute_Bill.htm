ï»¿S-1460.1SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5369State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Early Learning & K-12 Education (originally sponsored by Senators Orwall, Hasegawa, Krishnadasan, Liias, Nobles, Valdez, and C. Wilson)READ FIRST TIME 02/14/25.AN ACT Relating to enhancing youth mental health and well-being through advanced training and expansion of the workforce in schools; amending RCW 28A.410.044, 28A.320.280, and 28A.310.235; and adding new sections to chapter 28A.310 RCW.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. A new section is added to chapter 28A.310 RCW to read as follows:The legislature finds that Washington youth require additional support in order to thrive. Washington has the ninth highest school refusal rate in the country, with 30 percent of K-12 students missing more than 10 percent of the school year. A significant number of Washington's youth experience high rates of emotional, developmental, or behavioral distress, or thoughts of suicide.The legislature further finds that school social workers are uniquely positioned to contribute to K-12 student safety, address student behavioral health care needs, and support students with individualized education programs.

School social workers promote social and economic justice and are an integral part of the mental health continuum of care in the school setting.The legislature further finds that the national association of school social workers recommends a ratio of one school social worker to every 250 students, but that Washington has only one school social worker for every 3,798 students. Washington would need to increase this ratio by 93 percent to meet the national standard.It is therefore the intent of the legislature to increase student access to school social workers through workforce development and collaboration with community organizations and accredited university programs.Sec. 2.

In order that school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists have the time available to prioritize these functions, in addition to other activities requiring direct student contact, responsibilities such as data input and data tracking should be handled by nonlicensed, noncertified staff, where possible.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4.
