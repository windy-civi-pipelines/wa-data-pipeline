For those reasons, the legislature intends for the department of children, youth, and families to redesign the current community-based training pathway based on the building bridges curriculum.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.216.755'>43.216.755</a> and 2020 c 342 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">July</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">August</span> 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2021</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2025</span>, the department shall implement a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">redesigned</span> noncredit-bearing, community-based training pathway for licensed child care providers to meet professional education requirements associated with child care licensure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that is modeled after the building bridges community-based pathway</span>.
