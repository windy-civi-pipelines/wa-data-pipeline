Such notification may be provided electronically and include a request for additional information needed to confirm that the claimant has applied for only one residence.

A claimant who sells, transfers, or is displaced from the claimant's residence may transfer the claimant's exemption status to a replacement residence, but no claimant may receive the primary residence property tax exemption on more than one residence in any calendar year. However, the confinement of the claimant to a hospital, nursing home, assisted living facility, or adult family home will not disqualify the claim of exemption if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The residence is temporarily unoccupied;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The residence is occupied by either a spouse or state registered domestic partner, a person financially dependent on the claimant for support, or both; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The residence is rented for the purpose of paying the claimant's costs of a nursing home, hospital, assisted living facility, or adult family home.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) At the time of signing the application:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i)(A) The claimant must have owned, in fee or by contract purchase, or have held a life estate in, the residence for which the primary residence property tax exemption is claimed; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) The residence must have been located on a tax parcel with fewer than five residences; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the claimant resides in a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership, including a mobile home park cooperative or manufactured housing cooperative, the claimant must own a share in the cooperative representing the unit or dwelling in which the claimant resides or the lot on which the claimant's manufactured/mobile home or park model is situated.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) For purposes of this section, a residence owned by a marital community, state registered domestic partners, or cotenants is deemed to be owned by each spouse, domestic partner, or cotenant, and any lease for life or 99 years of a single-family dwelling unit or the land upon which it stands is deemed a life estate in the residence.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d)(i) The assessed value of a dwelling owned by a cooperative housing association, corporation, or partnership must be reduced, for purposes of state property taxes levied on the dwelling, by the amount of the primary residence property tax exemption to which a claimant residing in that dwelling is entitled.

If no amount is owed by the claimant to the remainderman or other person, the remainderman or other person must make payment to the claimant in the full amount of the tax savings from the claimant's primary residence property tax exemption.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7)(a)(i) If the assessor, as part of its existing program of real property inspection or general administration of property tax assessments, finds that the claimant's residence does not meet the qualifications for the primary residence property tax exemption, the assessor must cancel the primary residence property tax exemption and notify the department.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the assessor, as part of its existing program of real property inspection or general administration of property tax assessments, is unable to determine whether a property qualifies for the primary residence property tax exemption, the assessor must cancel the primary residence property tax exemption and notify the department.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A cancellation under (a) of this subsection (7) is subject to appeal under the provisions of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.48.010'>84.48.010</a> and in accordance with the provisions of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.40.038'>84.40.038</a>. If the assessor determines that the claimant had received the primary residence property tax exemption in error in prior years, the county treasurer must collect all state property taxes that would have been paid on the claimant's residence for the prior years had the primary residence property tax exemption not been claimed, not to exceed six years. Interest, but not penalties, applies to such taxes and is computed at the same rates and in the same way as interest is computed on delinquent taxes. Taxes and interest imposed under this subsection (7)(b):</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Must be extended on the tax roll;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Are due within 60 days after the date of the treasurer's billing for such taxes and interest; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Constitute a lien on the real property to which the tax and interest applies as provided in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.60'>84.60</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) The department may conduct audits of the administration of this section by the county assessors for the primary residence property tax exemption as the department considers necessary.
