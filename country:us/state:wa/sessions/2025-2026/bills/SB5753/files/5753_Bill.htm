Despite the state's economic growth, thousands of individuals remain homeless, including working families who cannot afford housing near their jobs, people who have lost their homes due to foreclosure or medical debt, and individuals with disabilities who are unable to work.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that Washington is experiencing a severe housing shortage, with projections indicating that 1,100,000 new housing units will be needed by 2040 to meet demand. However, current development trends suggest the state will fall at least 500,000 units short, exacerbating affordability challenges and deepening the housing crisis. While nonprofit developers and public housing authorities play a role in addressing housing insecurity, their efforts alone are insufficient to meet the scale of need.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature finds that previous approaches, tax breaks, incentives, and financial subsidies, have failed to generate the necessary housing supply. The private market has neither the incentive nor the ability to produce affordable housing at the scale required. Developers benefit from constrained supply, as rising property values increase profits, reducing their motivation to build affordable housing. Furthermore, reliance on tax incentives depletes state resources without correcting the underlying imbalance between housing supply and demand.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature further finds that housing has increasingly become a commodity for financial speculation rather than a basic human need. The financialization of housing, driven by global capital markets and speculative investment, has accelerated displacement and eroded affordability, particularly for low-income communities, people with disabilities, and communities of color. The rising cost of housing, combined with spatial segregation and economic exclusion, has left many Washington residents without stable, secure housing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature recognizes that Washington has both the means and responsibility to address this crisis, yet the gap between supply and demand continues to grow, leading to escalating housing costs across all income levels. The legislature intends to restore public housing as a core function of government. Public housing in the United States was historically undermined by deliberate government disinvestment and racially exclusionary policies, yet successful models from other jurisdictions demonstrate that well planned, publicly owned housing can provide long-term affordability and stability. The state and local governments collectively own vast amounts of public land, which must be strategically leveraged to reduce development costs and ensure housing remains permanently affordable.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The legislature further finds that local governments lack the financial and administrative capacity to address the housing crisis at the necessary scale.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Therefore, the legislature intends to look at establishing a statewide housing authority to oversee the development, maintenance, and operation of public housing. The authority should be tasked with ensuring that all public housing developments align with internationally recognized housing adequacy standards, including security of tenure, affordability, accessibility, and proximity to essential services. To support with financing for this effort, the legislature intends to look at creating a dedicated public housing account, which may be capitalized through legislative appropriations, dedicated revenue streams or other means and, if authorized, financing from a publicly owned depository bank.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The task force on public housing is established.
