ï»¿H-0858.1HOUSE BILL 1652State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Lekanoff, Ramel, Reed, Doglio, and ScottRead first time 01/28/25.Referred to Committee on Environment & Energy.AN ACT Relating to reducing environmental impacts associated with the operation of certain ocean-going vessels; reenacting and amending RCW 43.21B.110; adding a new chapter to Title 70A RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that the combustion of liquid fuels used by vessels transiting waters near Washington releases particulate matter that is harmful to human health on ship and on shore, and to the environment. Some technologies designed to reduce air pollution generated by vessel fuel combustion produce different harms to the environment. The legislature further finds that lower-sulfur fuels have fewer harmful emissions associated with their combustion, and do not require the use of onboard technologies that have harmful environmental impacts.(2) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to protect the public health and environment of Washington residents by requiring ocean-going vessels to use low-sulfur fuels when approaching Washington shores.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Auxiliary boiler" means any fuel-fired combustion equipment designed primarily to produce steam for uses other than propulsion including, but not limited to, heating of residual fuel and liquid cargo, heating of water for crew and passengers, powering steam turbine discharge pumps, freshwater generation, and space heating of cabins. Exhaust gas economizers that exclusively use diesel engine exhaust as a heat source to produce steam are not auxiliary boilers.(2) "Auxiliary engine" means a diesel engine on an ocean-going vessel designed primarily to provide power for uses other than propulsion or emergencies, except that all diesel-electric engines shall be considered "auxiliary diesel engines" for purposes of this section.(3) "Department" means the department of ecology.(4) "Main engine" means a diesel engine on an ocean-going vessel designed primarily to provide propulsion, other than a diesel-electric engine.(5) "Marine diesel oil" means any fuel that meets all the specifications for DMB grades as defined in table 1 of ISO 8217, as revised in 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference, or DMB grades as defined in table 1 of ISO 8217, as revised on June 15, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.(6) "Marine gas oil" means any fuel that meets all the specifications for DMX or DMA grades as defined in table 1 of ISO 8217, as revised in 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference, or DMX, DMA, or DMZ grades as defined in table 1 of ISO 8217, as revised on June 15, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.(7)(a) "Ocean-going vessel" means a commercial, government, or military vessel meeting any one of the following criteria:(i) A vessel other than a tank vessel greater than or equal to 400 feet in length overall (LOA) as defined in 50 C.F.R. Sec. 679.2 (1996);(ii) A vessel other than a tank vessel greater than or equal to 10,000 gross tons (GT ITC) per the convention measurement (international system) as defined in 46 C.F.R.
