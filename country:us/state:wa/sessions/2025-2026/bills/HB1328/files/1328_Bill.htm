The 2021 state energy strategy projects that Washington state must nearly double electricity consumption by 2050 to meet the state's greenhouse gas emissions limits and achieve the targets set by chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405'>19.405</a> RCW, the Washington clean energy transformation act. According to a 2023 net zero northwest study by the clean energy transition institute, meeting Washington's 2050 electricity needs through the most economically and technically efficient pathway will require building approximately 2/3 of this additional electricity generation in-state while also importing approximately 1/3 from out-of-state sources. According to the 2022 transmission corridors work group report, increased electricity demand will require significant increases in both in-state and interstate electrical transmission capacity within a relatively short time frame. Developing clean energy generation projects and additional electrical transmission capacity is essential to: Meeting the state's climate goals; growing family-wage clean energy jobs and innovative clean energy businesses and manufacturing that provide economic benefits across the state; and ensuring adequate, reliable, and affordable clean energy for residents and businesses.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that recent legislatively mandated studies identified significant concerns that impede the development of clean energy projects and electrical transmission facilities, unrelated to the regulatory process. These impediments include a lack of information related to clean energy projects, uncertainty over clean energy project impacts and benefits, inadequate engagement with tribes and communities, uncertainty regarding clean energy development under local zoning codes, and insufficient statewide planning to guide development of clean energy projects and electrical transmission facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends for this act to establish a framework for the state to provide the information, planning, and support needed to accelerate the pace of development for clean energy projects and electrical transmission facilities, while also protecting the environment, overburdened communities, and tribal rights, interests, and resources, including cultural resources, and bringing benefits to the communities that host clean energy projects. This act creates a clean energy development office to: Provide trusted information to the public and others; support planning and development of clean energy generation and transmission; and provide support to tribes, communities, and local governments as they consider proposals for clean energy projects and electrical transmission facilities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 through 6 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Clean energy project" has the same meaning as defined in RCWÂ  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.158.010'>43.158.010</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Department" means the department of commerce.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Director" means the director of the department.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Electrical transmission facilities" has the same meaning as defined in RCWÂ  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.158.010'>43.158.010</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Office" means the clean energy development office established in section 3 of this act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Overburdened communities" has the same meaning as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.02.010'>70A.02.010</a>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The clean energy development office is established within the department.
