The fire chief of each local fire department with jurisdiction over wildland fires<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, and each sheriff's office,</span> is tasked with making rapid decisions, especially during the summer months when weather conditions can cause fires to rapidly enlarge. Flashy fuels, especially during times of low humidity, can be ignited by a single spark and erupt into a rapidly moving incident that can quickly destroy rangelands, ripe dryland crops, and timberlands.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Local fire departments need immediate access to local aviation resources that are certified to<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, and some sheriff's offices have aircraft capable to,</span> fly and drop fire retardants and water to suppress or extinguish wildland fires quickly. The use of aviation assets has proven to be a valuable tool to prevent many wildland fires from growing large and requiring the response of state mobilization and prevent the deployment of state and federal fire agencies and their mobilization partner agencies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Further, the strategic use of aviation assets in initial attack, or at times when conditions on the ground may warrant additional air support, can prevent fires from becoming uncontrollable. Local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> that use aviation assets on initial attack can prevent most fires from requiring a state mobilization. Providing financial assurances for local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> to deploy aviation assets will provide greater protection to our state's natural resources, air quality, and communities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature intends to provide suppression funding to the department of natural resources to support local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> in the use of aviation resources certified and trained to operate in wildland fires and drop fire retardant or water to suppress or extinguish fires as an initial attack strategy. Deployment and air operations command will be conducted at the direction of trained air operations commanders.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature intends to authorize the department of natural resources to provide aviation resources to local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> statewide for use during the initial attack of wildland fires in order to provide assurance that local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> will have sufficient financial capacity to effectively control wildland fires throughout the length of the fire season. Having assurance that local fire departments <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and sheriff's offices</span> can afford to use aircraft under conditions that would warrant their use and at the discretion of the local fire department chief <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or sheriff</span> will incentivize the use of aircraft more quickly in order to rapidly suppress the fire and minimize damage to lands, resources, and structures, while protecting regional air quality.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
