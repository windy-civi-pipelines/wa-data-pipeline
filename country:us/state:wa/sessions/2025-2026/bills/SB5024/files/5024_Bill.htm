This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or to be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief to certain businesses or individuals.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to promote the development of small wineries. These small businesses face challenges entering the industry and it is the legislature's public policy objective to assist these wineries to grow and stabilize. Small wineries have faced significant challenges in recent years including the great recession, COVID-19 restrictions, impact of wildfire smoke, and weather challenges. Every year dozens of small wineries close their doors forever. The loss of these businesses means Washington loses not just the wine excise tax income from these wineries, but also the sales and use tax income, the business and occupation tax income, and the jobs, tourism opportunities, and community contributions these wineries would otherwise make.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The joint legislative audit and review committee must conduct an initial evaluation of the tax preference in this section by January 1, 2030.
