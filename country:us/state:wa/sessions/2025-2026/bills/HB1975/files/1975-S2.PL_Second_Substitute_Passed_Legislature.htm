In determining the addition to the baseline, the department may exclude a year from the determination if the department identifies that year to have been an outlier due to a state of emergency. The department shall adopt annual allowance budgets for the second compliance period of the program that will be distributed during the second compliance period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) By October 1, 2028, the department shall adopt by rule the annual allowance budgets for the end of the second compliance period through 2040.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The annual allowance budgets must be set to achieve the share of reductions by covered entities necessary to achieve the 2030, 2040, and 2050 statewide emissions limits established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by December 31st of each of those years</span>, based on data reported to the department under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15'>70A.15</a> RCW or provided as required by this chapter. Annual allowance budgets must be set such that the use of offsets as compliance instruments, consistent with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.170'>70A.65.170</a>, does not prevent the achievement of the emissions limits established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>. In so setting annual allowance budgets, the department must reduce the annual allowance budget relative to the limits in an amount equivalent to offset use, or in accordance with a similar methodology adopted by the department. The department must adopt annual allowance budgets for the program on a calendar year basis that provide for progressively equivalent reductions <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by December 31st of each year,</span> year over year. An allowance distributed under the program, either directly by the department under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.110'>70A.65.110</a> through  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.130'>70A.65.130</a> or through auctions under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.100'>70A.65.100</a>, does not expire and may be held or banked consistent with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.100'>70A.65.100</a>(6) and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.150'>70A.65.150</a>(1).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The department must complete evaluations by December 31, 2027, and December 31st of the year following the conclusion of the third compliance period, of the performance of the program, including its performance in reducing greenhouse gases. If the evaluation shows that adjustments to the annual allowance budgets are necessary for covered entities to achieve their proportionate share of the 2030 and 2040 emission reduction limits identified in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by December 31, 2030, and December 31, 2040</span>, as applicable, the department shall adjust the annual allowance budgets accordingly. The department must complete additional evaluations of the performance of the program by December 31st of the year following the conclusion of the fifth and sixth compliance periods, and make any necessary adjustments in the annual allowance budgets to ensure that covered entities achieve their proportionate share of the 2050 emission reduction limit identified in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>. Nothing in this subsection precludes the department from making additional adjustments to annual allowance budgets as necessary to ensure successful achievement of the proportionate emission reduction limits by covered entities. The department shall determine and make public the circumstances, metrics, and processes that would initiate the public consideration of additional allowance budget adjustments to ensure successful achievement of the proportionate emission reduction limits.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Data reported to the department under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.2200'>70A.15.2200</a> or provided as required by this chapter for 2015 through 2019 is deemed sufficient for the purpose of adopting annual allowance budgets and serving as the baseline by which covered entities demonstrate compliance under the first compliance period of the program. Data reported to the department under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.2200'>70A.15.2200</a> or provided as required by this chapter for 2023 through 2025 is deemed sufficient for adopting annual allowance budgets and serving as the baseline by which covered entities demonstrate compliance under the second compliance period of the program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature intends to promote a growing and sustainable economy and to avoid leakage of emissions from manufacturing to other jurisdictions.
