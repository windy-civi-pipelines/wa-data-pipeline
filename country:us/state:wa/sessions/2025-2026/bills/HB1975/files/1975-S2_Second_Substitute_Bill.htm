In determining the addition to the baseline, the department may exclude a year from the determination if the department identifies that year to have been an outlier due to a state of emergency.

Annual allowance budgets must be set such that the use of offsets as compliance instruments, consistent with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.170'>70A.65.170</a>, does not prevent the achievement of the emissions limits established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>. In so setting annual allowance budgets, the department must reduce the annual allowance budget relative to the limits in an amount equivalent to offset use, or in accordance with a similar methodology adopted by the department. The department must adopt annual allowance budgets for the program on a calendar year basis that provide for progressively equivalent reductions <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by December 31st of each year,</span> year over year.

If the evaluation shows that adjustments to the annual allowance budgets are necessary for covered entities to achieve their proportionate share of the 2030 and 2040 emission reduction limits identified in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">by December 31, 2030, and December 31, 2040</span>, as applicable, the department shall adjust the annual allowance budgets accordingly. The department must complete additional evaluations of the performance of the program by December 31st of the year following the conclusion of the fifth and sixth compliance periods, and make any necessary adjustments in the annual allowance budgets to ensure that covered entities achieve their proportionate share of the 2050 emission reduction limit identified in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>. Nothing in this subsection precludes the department from making additional adjustments to annual allowance budgets as necessary to ensure successful achievement of the proportionate emission reduction limits by covered entities.
