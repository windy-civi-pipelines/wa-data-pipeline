Burrowing shrimp in high densities pose a significant threat to shellfish farming operations and the surrounding aquatic ecosystem, causing damage to shellfish growing areas, negatively impacting productivity, and eliminating the growth of native eelgrass which provides essential habitat for salmonids and Dungeness crab, among other species.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) In addition, the legislature finds that since 1963, a control method developed in collaboration with the Washington state department of fish and wildlife had been effectively utilized. However, the phased-out use of carbaryl and the denial of a permit to use imidacloprid by the Washington state department of ecology left growers without crucial pest control measures. Burrowing shrimp infestations on shellfish grounds has led to a reduction in growing operations due to the absence of an effective control tool, and despite persistent efforts a viable alternative remains elusive.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) To address this ongoing crisis, the legislature intends to create an ongoing research program within the Washington state department of agriculture and fund research into new and innovative control methods for burrowing shrimp infestations. To support this program, the legislature intends to secure dedicated funding in the amount of $2,000,000 each biennium from the model toxics control act account.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=15.85'>15.85</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department of agriculture shall establish and administer an integrated pest management research program that focuses on addressing the impacts of burrowing shrimp on bottom culture shellfish farming.
