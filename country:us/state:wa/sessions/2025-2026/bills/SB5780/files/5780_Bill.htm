While it is the responsibility of each district to select and pay for each student transportation vehicle purchased by the district, each district shall be paid a sum based on the category of vehicle, anticipated lifetime of vehicles of this category, and state reimbursement rate for the category plus inflation as recognized by the reimbursement schedule established in this section as set by the superintendent. </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b)</span> Categories and reimbursement rates of vehicles shall be those established under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.160.195'>28A.160.195</a>. The accumulated value of the payments and the potential investment return thereon shall be designed to be equal to the replacement cost of the vehicle less its salvage value at the end of its anticipated lifetime.
