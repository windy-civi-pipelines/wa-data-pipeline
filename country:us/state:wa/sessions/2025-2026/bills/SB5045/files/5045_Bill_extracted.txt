RCW 70A.555.005 and 2023 c 434 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:The legislature finds that:(1) It is in the public interest of the citizens of Washington to encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, such as metals, that replace the output of mining and other extractive industries.(2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist.(3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling, and end-of-life management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, such as by igniting fires at solid waste handling facilities. For this reason, batteries should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or disposed of via traditional garbage collection containers.(4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by the end-of-life management of batteries. Because it is difficult for customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries, it is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all battery types and chemistries. ((Furthermore, it is appropriate for larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers, to be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program, both because of the potential economic value of large batteries used for these purposes and the anticipated profusion of these larger batteries as these market sectors mature.))(5) Larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers should be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program because of their potential economic value and anticipated profusion as these market sectors mature. Although the management of some larger batteries continues to be studied, the legislature intends to include electric vehicle batteries in the state battery stewardship program while recognizing the unique characteristics of those batteries.Sec. 8.

RCW 70A.555.005 and 2023 c 434 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:The legislature finds that:(1) It is in the public interest of the citizens of Washington to encourage the recovery and reuse of materials, such as metals, that replace the output of mining and other extractive industries.(2) Without a dedicated battery stewardship program, battery user confusion regarding proper disposal options will continue to persist.(3) Ensuring the proper handling, recycling, and end-of-life management of used batteries prevents the release of toxic materials into the environment and removes materials from the waste stream that, if mishandled, may present safety concerns to workers, such as by igniting fires at solid waste handling facilities. For this reason, batteries should not be placed into commingled recycling containers or disposed of via traditional garbage collection containers.(4) Jurisdictions around the world have successfully implemented battery stewardship laws that have helped address the challenges posed by the end-of-life management of batteries. Because it is difficult for customers to differentiate between types and chemistries of batteries, it is the best practice for battery stewardship programs to collect all battery types and chemistries. ((Furthermore, it is appropriate for larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers, to be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program, both because of the potential economic value of large batteries used for these purposes and the anticipated profusion of these larger batteries as these market sectors mature.))(5) Larger batteries used in emerging market sectors such as electric vehicles, solar power arrays, and data centers should be managed to ensure environmentally positive outcomes similar to those achieved by a battery stewardship program because of their potential economic value and anticipated profusion as these market sectors mature. Although the management of some larger batteries continues to be studied, the legislature intends to include electric vehicle batteries in the state battery stewardship program while recognizing the unique characteristics of those batteries.Sec. 8. RCW 70A.555.010 and 2023 c 434 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1)(a) "Battery-containing product" means a product that contains or is packaged with rechargeable or primary batteries that are covered batteries.(b) A "battery-containing product" does not include ((a)):(i) A covered electronic product under an approved plan implemented under chapter 70A.500 RCW; or(ii) An electric vehicle.(2) "Battery management hierarchy" means a management system of covered batteries prioritized in descending order as follows:(a) Waste prevention and reduction;(b) Reuse, when reuse is appropriate;(c) Recycling, as defined in this chapter; and(d) Other means of end-of-life management, which may only be utilized after demonstrating to the department that it is not feasible to manage the batteries under the higher priority options in (a) through (c) of this subsection.(3) "Battery stewardship organization" means a producer that directly implements a battery stewardship plan required under this chapter or a nonprofit organization designated by a producer or group of producers to implement a battery stewardship plan required under this chapter.(4) "Collection rate" means a percentage, by weight, that a battery stewardship organization collects that is calculated by dividing the total weight of primary and rechargeable batteries collected during the previous calendar year by the average annual weight of primary and rechargeable batteries that were estimated to have been sold in the state by all producers participating in an approved battery stewardship plan during the previous three calendar years.(5)(a) "Covered battery" means a portable battery or, beginning January 1, 2029, a medium format battery and an electric vehicle battery.(b) "Covered battery" does not include:(i) A battery contained within a medical device, as specified in Title 21 U.S.C.
