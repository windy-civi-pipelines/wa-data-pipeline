Across Washington state, the alarming statistics tell a grim story: At least 18 percent of students report feeling unsafe on school grounds and some have reported not attending school out of fear. Over 30 percent of students are not regularly attending school, and a staggering 70 percent of teachers report being afraid to go to work each day. More troubling still, 79 percent of teachers report having been subjected to physical violence, and 67 percent say that this violence has pushed them to the brink of leaving the profession. The legislature understands that it cannot continue to turn a blind eye to these realities.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) To begin to confront this crisis, the legislature intends to create a school safety data dashboard that will be accessible to the public, policymakers, schools, and parents. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide data on all school safety incidents, ensuring transparency and accountability. By gathering these statistics for the first time and making them easily accessible, the legislature intends to identify school districts and public schools that are struggling, and target supports to address local safety concerns and vulnerabilities. The legislature plans to hold school districts accountable for the safety of our children and the well-being of our educators, which starts with knowing where the problems lie.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature recognizes that to improve public school safety, investments in school facility security enhancements are necessary. Therefore, the legislature intends to establish school safety and security grants to help schools physically secure their buildings with a number of project types, including purchase and installation of facility key card access, remote door access, door locks, panic buttons, fencing, and more. Every public school should have the resources it needs to create a safe and secure learning environment for its students and staff.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Further, it is the intent of the legislature to provide every public school in Washington with the resources to employ a full-time school resource officer to promote a safe learning environment and to protect the safety and welfare of all students and school personnel. The presence of trained, professional security personnel is essential to creating an environment where students can focus on their education without fear and where educational staff can do their jobs without the threat of violence or disruption. School resource officers not only respond to emergencies, but also play a proactive role in building positive relationships with students, de-escalating potential conflicts, and fostering a culture of respect and responsibility within the school community. By ensuring that every school has a dedicated school resource officer, the state is taking a critical step toward safeguarding our schools and ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed in a secure environment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) However, the legislature recognizes that it is not enough to simply address physical security measures, but it must also reform student discipline policies to make schools conducive to learning and free from disruptions and violence. Teachers should be empowered to maintain order in their classrooms, and students should understand the consequences of harmful behavior. Therefore, the legislature further intends to foster better working relationships between school administrators and teachers in disciplinary decision making in order to create an environment where every student can thrive academically.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The legislature acknowledges that, in 2019, bipartisan legislation was enacted to make comprehensive school safety reforms. Therefore, the legislature intends to require an evaluation of these reforms so that stakeholders and policymakers have a clearer picture on the use and effectiveness of those policies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Finally, the legislature finds that the crisis facing our schools is undeniable and demands immediate action. As Washington faces the growing trend of students leaving public schools, whether through increasing private school enrollment or home-based instruction, the legislature must take action. Every child deserves to learn in a safe, secure, and supportive environment. The legislature believes this act will ensure that our schools are not only places of education, but places where students, teachers, and staff feel safe, respected, and valued.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.300'>28A.300</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall establish and maintain on its website a school safety dashboard.
