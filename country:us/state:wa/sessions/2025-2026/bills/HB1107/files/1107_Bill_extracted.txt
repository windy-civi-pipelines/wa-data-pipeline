ï»¿H-0297.1HOUSE BILL 1107State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Mena, Ramel, Berry, Reed, Macri, Doglio, Gregerson, Simmons, Peterson, Goodman, Pollet, Kloba, Duerr, Berg, Ormsby, Scott, Reeves, Bernbaum, and HillPrefiled 12/20/24.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Environment & Energy.AN ACT Relating to environmental impacts of fashion; amending RCW 70A.430.060; reenacting and amending RCW 43.21B.110 and 43.21B.300; adding a new chapter to Title 70A RCW; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that the fashion industry has many negative environmental impacts, including high levels of water use, runoff pollution from the use of agrochemicals and dyes, carbon emissions, industry waste, and hazardous work environments.(2) The United Nations estimates that a single pair of jeans requires a kilogram of cotton, and because cotton tends to be grown in dry environments, producing this kilogram requires about 7,500 to 10,000 liters of water, which is approximately 10 years' worth of drinking water for one person. The industry accounts for nearly 20 percent of global wastewater, with fabric dyes polluting water bodies and impacting aquatic life and drinking water. Cotton production also uses a high amount of fertilizers and pesticides, discharging toxic substances to waterways. In terms of greenhouse gases, the fashion industry accounts for about eight to 10 percent of global carbon emissions, more than both aviation and shipping combined.(3) The synthetic polymer polyester is the most common fabric used in clothing and, globally, 65 percent of the clothing that we wear is polymer-based. Around 70,000,000 barrels of oil a year are used to make polyester fibers in our clothes, from waterproof jackets to scarves. Polyester takes hundreds of years to decompose and can lead to microfibers escaping into the environment. The United States environmental protection agency estimates that in 2018, 11,300,000 tons of textiles ended up in landfills, while another 3,200,000 tons were incinerated. According to the Ellen MacArthur foundation, the average number of times a piece of clothing is worn decreased by 36 percent between 2000 and 2015, and according to the world bank, 40 percent of clothing purchased in some countries is never used.(4) The legislature intends for Washington to serve as a leader in mitigating the environmental impact of the fashion industry by requiring disclosure of certain environmental impacts by fashion producers and sellers and by studying and planning for additional measures to reduce fashion's impacts.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
