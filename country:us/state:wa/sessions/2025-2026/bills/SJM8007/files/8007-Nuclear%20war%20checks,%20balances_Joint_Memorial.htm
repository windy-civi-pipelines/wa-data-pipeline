On August 2, 2019, the United States formally withdrew from the INF Treaty; andWHEREAS, A single nuclear detonation in any major city in Washington could cause hundreds of thousands of immediate fatalities, hundreds of thousands of injuries and illnesses from radiation, and devastating destruction of agricultural land and natural resources for decades; andWHEREAS, Washington state has the largest collection of deployed nuclear weapons in the Western Hemisphere, at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor on Hood Canal, just 20 miles from Seattle, Washington; andWHEREAS, This nuclear weapons installation, added to Washington state's large city centers and many other military installations, makes our state a primary target in the event of a nuclear exchange; andWHEREAS, Washington state is home to many other nuclear weapons sites and nuclear reactor facilities, including: The Hanford Nuclear Site, the most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere; the Midnite Mine, a former nuclear weapons uranium mine located on the Spokane Tribe of Indians Reservation; and one of the largest populations of Marshall Islanders in the United States, whose home was the site of 67 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War; andWHEREAS, These nuclear weapons sites and activities disproportionately affect communities of color and indigenous people, none of whom have been adequately compensated for the environmental and health consequences of nuclear weapons activities pursued by the United States government during the 50 years of the Cold War; andWHEREAS, These nuclear weapons and nuclear-related activities in Washington state make this a uniquely local responsibility for Washington state to lead a national conversation about reducing and eliminating the threat of nuclear war, and revamping our federal strategy, which is also known as mutually assured destruction (MAD); andWHEREAS, Washington's citizens, and all Americans have an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and to live a life free from the threat of nuclear weapons; andWHEREAS, The United States could lead a global effort to prevent nuclear war by:(1) Renouncing the option of using nuclear weapons first;(2) Ending the President's sole, unchecked authority to launch a nuclear attack;(3) Taking United States nuclear weapons off hair-trigger alert;(4) Canceling the plan to replace its entire arsenal with next generation nuclear weapons; and(5) Actively pursuing a verifiable, multilateral agreement among nuclear-armed states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals;NOW, THEREFORE, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that Congress take appropriate steps to move back from the brink of nuclear war by establishing a system of checks and balances to ensure that the President shall no longer have the sole, unchecked authority to launch nuclear weapons, except in circumstances of retaliation to a nuclear attack, and making it the policy of the United States to not use nuclear weapons first.BE IT RESOLVED, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington.--- END ---
