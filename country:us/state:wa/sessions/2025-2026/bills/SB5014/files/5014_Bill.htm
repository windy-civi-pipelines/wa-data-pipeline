The legislature further finds that:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(a) Requiring the use of the ".gov" top-level domain on all websites and email communication reduces opportunities for confusion and cyber threats. The ".gov" top-level domain is managed by the United States department of homeland security through the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, is limited to bona fide government agencies, and features fraud prevention controls. There is no fee charged to adopt a ".gov" top-level domain.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Requiring the partitioning of internal government networks, servers, and other supporting electronic infrastructure separate from other electronic equipment housed in the same location or locations can also provide a more secure environment. Partitioning means physically and electronically separating election and voting infrastructure from other county assets with the goal of reducing vulnerability to attacks that may occur on other parts of a county's cyber infrastructure. Partitioning also allows access to the infrastructure to be more tightly controlled and monitored.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Because the secretary of state and county election offices are electronically interconnected and speedy communication with the state when a county is under attack or has suffered a security breach is imperative, requiring all vendors supporting county or state cyber assets to communicate to the secretary of state and the attorney general immediately after detecting a breach or successful cyber attack against their assets is necessary to maintain security.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature intends to require adoption of these security measures in all county election offices as soon as practicable, but no later than July 1, 2027.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.12.050'>29A.12.050</a> and 2003 c 111 s 305 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">If voting</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(1) The secretary of state must approve systems used in the conduct of elections prior to the system being used in conducting any primary or election, including the following:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) Voting</span> systems ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">or</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, voting</span> devices<span style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span> or vote tallying systems ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">are to be used for conducting a primary or election, only those that have the approval of the secretary of state or had been</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, unless</span> approved under this chapter or the former chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29.34'>29.34</a> RCW before March 22, 1982((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">, may be used</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) Any mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic equipment or platform, including software, firmware, or hardware that is used to provide voter assistance.
