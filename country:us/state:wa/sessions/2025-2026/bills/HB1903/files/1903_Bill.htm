Many income-eligible households do not have sufficient support. The department of commerce November 2024 study of options for a statewide energy assistance program in Washington lays out core features of a just system to expand and secure access to energy affordability measures. To address present and widening disparities in household access to energy assistance will require easier applications, safe data sharing, low barrier eligibility determinations, systematic processes for filling in gaps in the reach of existing programs, and guaranteed funding sources. The recommended program design promotes a more centralized approach to energy assistance. Key elements include those that reduce administrative burdens, but also improve the experience and likelihood that an eligible household receives assistance.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.330'>43.330</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Low-income" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.020'>19.405.020</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Community action council" has the same meaning as "community action agency" in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.185C.010'>43.185C.010</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Energy assistance" means monetary assistance, such as a grant program or discounts for low-income households, that lowers a low-income household's energy burden.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Energy burden" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.020'>19.405.020</a>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.330'>43.330</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The statewide low-income energy assistance program is established within the department.
