Article I, section 3 guarantees that "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."Moreover, Article I, section 7 states that "No person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law," and Article I, section 24 provides that "The right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself, or the state, shall not be impaired."Furthermore, the legislature finds that reasonable exemptions from restrictions on firearms rights promote the safe and responsible use of firearms. The legislature also finds that by expanding exemptions from restrictions on firearms rights for persons providing safety classes or engaging in shooting sports, current and retired peace officers, active duty military personnel, veterans, and valid concealed pistol license holders, all contribute to creating safer communities.Lastly, the legislature concludes that expanding exemptions from restrictions on access to so-called excess capacity magazines and assault weapons, and exempting certain individuals from current law background check waiting periods, who have already been subject to background checks, will serve to promote respect for the appropriate storage, maintenance, handling, and use of firearms, by a well-trained citizenry.PART IIDEFINED TERMSSec. 2.
