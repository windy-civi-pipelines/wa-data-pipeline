Port operations, including vessel emissions, are a significant contributor to diesel particulate matter and greenhouse gases in the Seattle-Tacoma airshed;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Maritime-related emissions make up 20 percent of total diesel particulate matter emissions in the Puget Sound airshed â a huge avoidable risk;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) In the United States, nearly 40 percent of Americans live within three miles of a port where ocean-going vessels are the number one driver of cancer risk to frontline communities at ports due to their diesel particulate emissions;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution is necessary to protect port communities, where pollution has disproportionately harmed working class communities and communities of color living in and near United States ports;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Opting into the California emission standards for ocean-going vessels at berth will provide significant and necessary air quality and climate benefits to residents of the state of Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) Under the federal clean air act, Washington has the option to implement California's vehicle emission standards such as the control measures for ocean-going vessels at berth;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Adoption of California's control measures for ocean-going vessels at berth coincides with record levels of federal and state funding available for ports that will support compliance with the emission standards. The Washington state legislature has allocated tens of millions of dollars for shore power at the state's ports;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) The Washington state transportation electrification strategy report supports such recommendation: "In addition to infrastructure upgrades, the state should explore adopting California's 2020 ocean-going vessels at-berth regulation to ensure that shipping companies utilize the shore power being added to the ports"; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) Construction of shore power helps support jobs. A study conducted by MARAD in 2017 indicates that employment projections for 100 percent shore power by 2050 in Washington state range from 302 to 526 job-years at the state level, and from 232 to 405 job-years at the county level.
