An increase in the annual limit of services and activities fees would help offset inflationary pressures and ensure these services can continue to operate effectively. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide the opportunity for students to raise the services and activities fees while keeping the fee process for approval the same.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.15.069'>28B.15.069</a> and 2018 c 202 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The building fee for each academic year shall be a percentage of total tuition fees.
