Current public-private partnership laws have failed to spur innovative proposals from the private sector or new project delivery approaches from the department of transportation.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(b) The legislature confirms the findings from previous studies that current laws and administrative processes are the primary obstacle impairing the state's ability to utilize public-private partnerships. The legislature finds that a new public-private partnership law is needed to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Transparently demonstrate and deliver better value for the public including, but not limited to, expedited project delivery and more effective management of project life-cycle costs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Provide an additional option for delivering complex transportation projects, including addressing a shortage of truck parking;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Incorporate private sector expertise and innovation into transportation project delivery;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Allocate project risks to the parties best able to manage those risks;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Allow new sources of private capital;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) Increase access to federal funding and financing mechanisms;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) Better align private sector incentives with public priorities; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(viii) Provide consistency in the review and approval processes for the full range of project delivery tools and contracting methods.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature further finds that there is a need to develop other innovative approaches to deliver transportation infrastructure in a manner that maximizes value and addresses the increasing costs of project delivery. Requiring mandatory review and approval of other alternative project delivery models available to the department of transportation stifles procurement and timely project delivery. Expanded and expedited use of alternative project delivery models, like progressive design-build and general contractor/construction manager procedures, without mandatory approval or review by the capital projects advisory review board will deliver better value for the public and provide the department of transportation with more options to deliver complex transportation projects. This will also give the department of transportation the needed flexibility to adapt to changing conditions, and result in fewer delays in project delivery. Any use of such delivery models should continue to strive and adhere to disadvantaged business enterprise and small business enterprise program contract goals.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">I.
