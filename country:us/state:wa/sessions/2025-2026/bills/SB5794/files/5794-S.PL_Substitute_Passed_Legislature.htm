The exemptions result in nearly $200,000,000,000 of taxpayer savings for the current biennium. The legislature acknowledges that certain tax preferences, such as the sales and use tax exemption for food and the working families tax credit, are intended to rebalance Washington's tax code for working people. However, the legislature further acknowledges that many existing tax preferences are the result of private interests securing preferential tax treatment.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) For that reason, the legislature enacted robust tax preference performance measures to create greater tax preference transparency and accountability and provide a framework for legislators to make informed decisions on the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. To ensure tax exemptions meet certain public policy objectives, the joint legislative audit and review committee, a nonpartisan legislative agency, routinely evaluates tax preferences based on specific criteria provided in law and reports that information to the legislature each year. The reports provide accurate, comprehensive, unbiased data that policymakers may use to determine if a tax preference should be continued, modified, or repealed. Additionally, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences is responsible for selecting which tax preferences are reviewed each year and provides comment on the legislative auditor's reports. Both entities provide recommendations to the legislature on the effectiveness of a tax preference in meeting certain performance measures.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Furthermore, the department of revenue assists in the tax preference evaluation process by collecting data from taxpayer beneficiaries and regularly reviewing changes in state and federal law. The analysis by the department and legislative auditor often reveals that a tax exemption is legally obsolete, meaning the specific legal conditions that existed when the exemption was enacted have since changed and the original legislative intent is no longer applicable. Additionally, some tax exemptions are simply not used and should be removed from the tax code to create better clarity for taxpayers.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature recognizes that more progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that provides sustainable and ample funding for public schools, health care, and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, as well as social services that provide critical, basic-needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents. The legislature further recognizes that the tax preference performance review process provides an opportunity for policymakers to evaluate the tax code to ensure the state is not losing essential revenue due to inefficient or no longer applicable tax exemptions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Thus, the legislature intends to enact recommendations from the joint legislative audit and review committee, the citizen commission for performance measurement of tax preferences, and the department of revenue, including eliminating several obsolete tax preferences, clarifying legislative intent to better inform future tax preference performance reviews, adding expiration dates, and other actions aimed at creating a fair and balanced tax system.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">PART I</span></div><div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">ELIMINATING OBSOLETE TAX PREFERENCES</span></div></div><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 101.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.260'>82.04.260</a> and 2023 c 422 s 5 and 2023 c 286 s 3 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Upon every person engaging within this state in the business of manufacturing:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Wheat into flour, barley into pearl barley, soybeans into soybean oil, canola into canola oil, canola meal, or canola by-products, or sunflower seeds into sunflower oil; as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is equal to the value of the flour, pearl barley, oil, canola meal, or canola by-product manufactured, multiplied by the rate of 0.138 percent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Beginning July 1, 2035, seafood products that remain in a raw, raw frozen, or raw salted state at the completion of the manufacturing by that person; or selling manufactured seafood products that remain in a raw, raw frozen, or raw salted state at the completion of the manufacturing, to purchasers who transport in the ordinary course of business the goods out of this state; as to such persons the amount of tax with respect to such business is equal to the value of the products manufactured or the gross proceeds derived from such sales, multiplied by the rate of 0.138 percent.
