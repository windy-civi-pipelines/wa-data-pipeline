Both laws govern the types of generation resources that utilities may use to provide electricity to Washington residents. As a result of this overlap, utilities are subject to multiple standards for the same activity. The legislature intends to address this unnecessary duplication by retaining the conservation elements of the energy independence act while ending the generation requirements. This will not create a gap in Washington's energy laws because the requirements of the clean energy transformation act continue to set the policy direction for the state. The legislature intends for this act to create efficiencies and cost savings for utilities, which will provide affordable power to consumers.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.010'>19.285.010</a> and 2007 c 1 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">This chapter concerns requirements for new energy resources.</span>)) This chapter requires large utilities to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">obtain fifteen percent of their electricity from new renewable resources such as solar and wind by 2020 and</span>)) undertake cost-effective energy conservation.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.020'>19.285.020</a> and 2007 c 1 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Increasing energy conservation ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">and the use of appropriately sited renewable energy facilities</span>)) builds on the strong foundation of low-cost renewable hydroelectric generation in Washington state and will promote energy independence in the state and the Pacific Northwest region.

Nothing in the rule adopted under this subsection precludes a qualifying utility from using its utility specific conservation measures, values, and assumptions in identifying its achievable cost-effective conservation potential.

At a minimum, each biennial target must be no lower than the qualifying utility's pro rata share for that two-year period of its cost-effective conservation potential for the subsequent ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ten</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10</span>-year period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c)(i) Except as provided in (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, beginning on January 1, 2014, cost-effective conservation achieved by a qualifying utility in excess of its biennial acquisition target may be used to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 20 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Beginning January 1, 2014, a qualifying utility may use single large facility conservation savings in excess of its biennial target to meet up to an additional five percent of the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c)(ii), "single large facility conservation savings" means cost-effective conservation savings achieved in a single biennial period at the premises of a single customer of a qualifying utility whose annual electricity consumption prior to the conservation savings exceeded five average megawatts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, and until December 31, 2017, a qualifying utility with an industrial facility located in a county with a population between 95,000 and 115,000 that is directly interconnected with electricity facilities that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage may use cost-effective conservation from that industrial facility in excess of its biennial acquisition target to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In meeting its conservation targets, a qualifying utility may count high-efficiency cogeneration owned and used by a retail electric customer to meet its own needs.

The utility must demonstrate that for every megawatt-hour of early action compliance credit there is a real, permanent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the western interconnection directly associated with that credit. A multistate electric utility must request to use early action compliance credit in its clean energy implementation plan that is submitted under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.060'>19.405.060</a>.
