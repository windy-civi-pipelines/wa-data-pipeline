Communications exclusively with the governor, legislators, or state agency staff regarding a potential or intended contract termination do not constitute a public statement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Nothing in this section requires a carrier, health care facility, or health care provider to provide notice of a potential termination to enrollees, unless required to do so as a regulatory or legal requirement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Public statements or communication with health plan enrollees or patients by a carrier, health care facility, or health care provider may not occur prior to the date the carrier, health care facility, or health care provider has given written notice of the termination to the other party, unless agreed upon by both parties.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4)(a) By December 1, 2025, the commissioner, in consultation with health carriers, health care providers, health care facilities, and consumers, must develop standard template language for notices sent to health plan enrollees and patients by health carriers, health care providers, or health care facilities pursuant to this section. The standard template language must be posted on the commissioner's website.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Notices developed pursuant to this section must include, at a minimum:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A reference to the specific facility or facilities by name that would be affected by the potential contract termination or expiration and an indication of whether the potential termination or expiration would apply to hospital-based providers;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Direction to enrollees related to appointments that are scheduled past the date of the potential contract termination or expiration date; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Information concerning the enrollee's continuity of care rights pursuant to the federal no surprises act, 42 U.S.C.

Notices to enrollees or patients that do not utilize the template language in full, or add to or revise the language of the template developed pursuant to this section, must be reviewed and approved by the commissioner before being used in any manner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) By January 1, 2027, the requirements of this section must be included in all provider contracts.

The commissioner may provide the health care provider or health care facility with an opportunity to explain why the actions in question did not violate this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) If any health care provider or health care facility violates this section, the department of health, other appropriate health care facility licensing entity, or the appropriate health profession disciplining authority may levy a fine or cost recovery upon the health care provider or health care facility in an amount not to exceed the applicable statutory amount per violation and take other action as permitted under the authority of the department of health or disciplining authority.
