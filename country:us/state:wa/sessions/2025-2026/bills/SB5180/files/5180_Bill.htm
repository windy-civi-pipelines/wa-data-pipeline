To this end, in 2012, the office of the superintendent of public instruction adopted guidelines for school districts related to prohibiting discrimination in public schools that specifically addressed gender identity and gender expression and established protections for transgender students.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) In 2019, the legislature again took action to protect students at risk of discriminatory treatment by directing the Washington state school directors' association to collaborate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to develop and update a model transgender student policy and procedure that recognized the importance of an inclusive approach toward transgender and gender-expansive students.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) In 2020, each school district was required to adopt a policy and procedure that incorporated all the elements of the model policy. The legislature finds, unfortunately, that some school districts are not necessarily implementing the model policy and are reading ambiguity into the laws related to the specific requirements of this model policy.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The legislature therefore intends to clearly state the required components of the model policy and procedure, so no ambiguity remains in the legislative intent to protect all students from discriminatory treatment in our schools. The legislature further intends to provide protections for personnel employed by or contracted with school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools who support students in the exercise of their rights and perform work activities in a manner consistent with state law.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.642.080'>28A.642.080</a> and 2023 c 242 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i)</span> By January 31, 2020, each school district must adopt or amend if necessary policies and procedures that, at a minimum, incorporate all the elements of the model ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">transgender student</span>)) policy and procedure <span style="text-decoration:underline;">relating to gender inclusive schools</span> described in subsection (3) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) At the next regularly scheduled meeting of each school district board of directors after the effective date of this section, school districts must amend if necessary policies and procedures that meet the requirements in this section.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) School districts must share the policies and procedures that meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection with parents or guardians, students, volunteers, and school employees in accordance with rules adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction.
