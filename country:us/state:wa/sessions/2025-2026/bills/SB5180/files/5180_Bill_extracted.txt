ï»¿S-0339.2SENATE BILL 5180State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators C. Wilson, Liias, Dhingra, Lovick, Nobles, Orwall, Pedersen, SaldaÃ±a, Stanford, Trudeau, Valdez, and WellmanPrefiled 01/08/25.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Early Learning & K-12 Education.AN ACT Relating to securing the rights of students to have a safe, civil, and respectful learning community that is free of discrimination by ensuring all schools adopt and enforce gender inclusive protections, policies, and procedures; amending RCW 28A.642.080, 28A.715.020, 28A.300.535, 28A.600.477, and 28A.642.090; adding a new section to chapter 28A.400 RCW; and creating a new section.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that Washington state has long been at the forefront of recognizing that student success is dependent on providing every student with a safe, inclusive learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination in all forms.(2) In 2010, the legislature created expansive provisions specific to public schools clearly stating that all students have the right to exist free from discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin, honorably discharged veteran or military status, sexual orientation including gender expression or identity, the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, or the use of a trained dog guide or service animal by a person with a disability.(3) The legislature directed the office of the superintendent of public instruction to monitor and enforce compliance with this law. To this end, in 2012, the office of the superintendent of public instruction adopted guidelines for school districts related to prohibiting discrimination in public schools that specifically addressed gender identity and gender expression and established protections for transgender students.(4) In 2019, the legislature again took action to protect students at risk of discriminatory treatment by directing the Washington state school directors' association to collaborate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to develop and update a model transgender student policy and procedure that recognized the importance of an inclusive approach toward transgender and gender-expansive students.(5) In 2020, each school district was required to adopt a policy and procedure that incorporated all the elements of the model policy. The legislature finds, unfortunately, that some school districts are not necessarily implementing the model policy and are reading ambiguity into the laws related to the specific requirements of this model policy.(6) The legislature therefore intends to clearly state the required components of the model policy and procedure, so no ambiguity remains in the legislative intent to protect all students from discriminatory treatment in our schools. The legislature further intends to provide protections for personnel employed by or contracted with school districts, charter schools, and state-tribal education compact schools who support students in the exercise of their rights and perform work activities in a manner consistent with state law.Sec. 2. RCW 28A.642.080 and 2023 c 242 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:(1)(a)(i) By January 31, 2020, each school district must adopt or amend if necessary policies and procedures that, at a minimum, incorporate all the elements of the model ((transgender student)) policy and procedure relating to gender inclusive schools described in subsection (3) of this section.(ii) At the next regularly scheduled meeting of each school district board of directors after the effective date of this section, school districts must amend if necessary policies and procedures that meet the requirements in this section.(b) School districts must share the policies and procedures that meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection with parents or guardians, students, volunteers, and school employees in accordance with rules adopted by the office of the superintendent of public instruction. This requirement as it relates to students, parents, and guardians may be satisfied by using the model student handbook language in RCW 28A.300.286.(c)(i) Each school district must designate one person in the school district as the primary contact regarding the policies and procedures relating to ((transgender students))gender inclusive schools that meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection. In addition to any other duties required by law and the school district, the primary contact must:(A) Ensure the implementation of the policies and procedures relating to ((transgender students))gender inclusive schools that meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection;(B) Receive copies of all formal and informal complaints relating to transgender students and gender expansive students;(C) Communicate with the school district employees responsible for monitoring school district compliance with this chapter, and the primary contact regarding the school district's policy and procedure prohibiting harassment, intimidation, and bullying under RCW 28A.600.477; and(D) Serve as the primary contact between the school district, the office of the education ombuds, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction on policies and procedures relating to ((transgender students))gender inclusive schools that meet the requirements of (a) of this subsection.(ii) The primary contact from each school district must attend at least one training class as provided in RCW 28A.600.477, once this training is available.(iii) The primary contact may also serve as the primary contact regarding the school district's policy and procedure prohibiting harassment, intimidation, and bullying under RCW 28A.600.477 and the primary contact regarding school district compliance with nondiscrimination laws under RCW 28A.300.286.(2) As required by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, each school district must provide to the office of the superintendent of public instruction its policies and procedures relating to ((transgender students))gender inclusive schools that meet the requirements of subsection (1)(a) of this section.(3)(a) By September 1, 2019, and periodically thereafter, the Washington state school directors' association must collaborate with the office of the superintendent of public instruction to develop and update a model ((transgender student)) policy and procedure relating to gender inclusive schools.(b) The elements of the model ((transgender student)) policy and procedure relating to gender inclusive schools must, at a minimum:(i) Incorporate the office of the superintendent of public instruction's rules and guidelines developed under RCW 28A.642.020 to eliminate discrimination in Washington public schools on the basis of gender expression and gender identity ((and expression)); ((address))(ii) Address the unique challenges and needs faced by transgender students and gender-expansive students in public schools; and ((describe))(iii) Describe the application of the model policy and procedure prohibiting harassment, intimidation, and bullying, required under RCW 28A.600.477, to transgender students and gender-expansive students.(c) The elements of the model policy and procedure relating to gender inclusive schools must include the following specific components:(i) That students have the right to be referred to by their preferred name and pronouns at school;(ii) That students have the right to participate in school-sponsored athletics or activities, or both, in a manner that is consistent with their gender expression or gender identity;(iii) That students have the right to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender expression or gender identity;(iv) That students have the right to dress in a manner that is consistent with their gender expression or gender identity within the constraints of the dress codes or uniform established pursuant to the policies established and allowed by RCW 28A.320.140 and within the constraints of school district guidelines for dress as they relate to health and safety issues; and(v) That personnel employed by or contracted with a school district or educational service district must not disclose any information related to a student's sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender identity to any person without the student's consent.
