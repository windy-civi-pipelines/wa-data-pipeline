Washington is the proud home of the seventh largest Asian American population and third largest Pacific Islander population in the nation, which make up nearly 12 percent of our state's population. Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander residents have made valuable contributions to all areas of Washington, including in government, business, arts and sciences, medicine, law enforcement, and the military;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Yet, Washington state has seen an increase in hate crimes and violence against historically marginalized groups, two-thirds of which are based on race or ethnicity. According to local and national surveys, there has been a particularly significant rise in Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander youth experiencing bullying and racism;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Regardless of one's background, every student in Washington state has a right to feel safe at school and in their communities;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Teaching students about Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander history and contributions is an important response to the hateful rhetoric and violence the Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community has experienced in recent years, and a preventive measure to guard against such rhetoric and violence in the future. For Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students specifically, it will bolster their mental health and sense of belonging in the state they call home. For all Washington students, this education would foster a stronger sense of community and shared history, underlining the struggles and values that connect all of us as Americans;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Consistent with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655.300'>28A.655.300</a>, the legislature recognizes the importance of public school students being global citizens in a global society with an appreciation for the contributions of diverse cultures. Research has shown that using historically accurate curricula that are inclusive of historically marginalized and underrepresented groups helps address lack of representation or misrepresentation; and leads to positive changes in students' attitudes, values, empathy, participation, academic performance, and attendance rates;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Too often, Asian Americans are viewed as either the "model minority" or "perpetual foreigner," or both and omitted from ethnic studies, United States history, and Washington history curricula and instruction altogether. For Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, many of these traditionally overburdened communities have been defined, excluded, and underserved by systems and institutions for decades.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Accordingly, and with the support of Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community-based organizations, the legislature intends for education regarding the history of Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders be mandatory in Washington's common schools.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655'>28A.655</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By September 1, 2028, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall adopt Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander history learning standards as part of the state social studies learning standards and shall identify available curricula and other instructional materials that are aligned to those standards for use by school districts and collected in collaboration with leaders of Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander community-based organizations and the statewide association of educational service districts.
