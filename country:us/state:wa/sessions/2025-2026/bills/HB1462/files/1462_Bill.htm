ï»¿H-0348.2HOUSE BILL 1462State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Duerr, Berry, Doglio, Fitzgibbon, Reed, Ramel, Parshley, Goodman, Macri, Kloba, and HuntRead first time 01/21/25.Referred to Committee on Environment & Energy.AN ACT Relating to reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with hydrofluorocarbons by transitioning to environmentally and economically sustainable alternatives and promoting use of reclaimed hydrofluorocarbons; amending RCW 70A.60.010; reenacting and amending RCW 39.26.310; adding new sections to chapter 70A.60 RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that:(a) Hydrofluorocarbons are potent greenhouse gases with global warming potentials that are hundreds to thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. The widespread use of hydrofluorocarbon in refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pumps, among other applications, makes them significant contributors to climate change;(b) Short-lived climate pollutants, such as hydrofluorocarbons, create an acute warming influence despite their shorter atmospheric lifespan. Reducing short-lived climate pollutant emissions is essential for mitigating near-term climate risks and preventing irreversible climate tipping points, such as polar ice sheet collapse and permafrost thaw;(c) Life-cycle refrigerant management, which encompasses leak prevention, recovery, reclamation, and safe disposal of refrigerants, is a critical strategy for reducing emissions across the entire life cycle of refrigerant use. Effective life-cycle refrigerant management is necessary to meet state, federal, and international climate goals;(d) The Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol and the American innovation and manufacturing act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 7675), establish phased reductions in hydrofluorocarbon production and consumption but leave gaps in ensuring widespread use of reclaimed refrigerants and managing refrigerants at the end of their life cycle; and(e) State action is urgently needed to complement federal and international efforts by promoting the transition to climate-friendly refrigerants with lower or no global warming potential, enhancing refrigerant recovery systems, and preventing emissions through stronger regulations and market-based incentives.(2) It is the intent of the legislature to:(a) Lead by example in promoting reclaimed refrigerants by requiring their use in servicing and repairing state-owned equipment;(b) Study feasible pathways to an expeditious transition of new equipment by 2035 to low global warming potential refrigerants of less than 150 carbon dioxide equivalents and ultra-low global warming potential refrigerants of less than 10 carbon dioxide equivalents;(c) Support the development of robust refrigerant recovery infrastructure and foster public-private partnerships to promote the reclamation and reuse of refrigerants;(d) Establish a clear regulatory framework for reducing emissions from refrigerants through phased limitations on high global warming potential substances and increasing recovery and use of reclaimed refrigerants; and(e) Enhance industry compliance and stakeholder collaboration through education, training, and financial incentives, ensuring alignment with national and international climate objectives.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 70A.60 RCW to read as follows:(1) It is prohibited to sell, distribute, or otherwise enter into commerce in the state virgin bulk hydrofluorocarbons or virgin bulk hydrofluorocarbon blends that:(a) Have a global warming potential that exceeds 2,200, beginning January 1, 2027;(b) Have a global warming potential that exceeds 1,500, beginning January 1, 2030; and(c) Have a global warming potential that exceeds 750, beginning January 1, 2033.(2)(a) The department shall adopt rules to implement the requirements of this section.(b) The department may adopt by rule lower global warming potential limits than are specified in subsection (1) of this section, or earlier dates for global warming potential limits than are specified in subsection (1) of this section, provided the department finds that an adequate supply of reclaimed refrigerant would be available in the state to accommodate any such change to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.(c) When adopting rules to conform to this section, the department may update the definitions of terms used in this section, including the definitions of "bulk" and "reclaim" in RCW 70A.60.010, in order to maintain consistency with federal regulations or to harmonize the department's rules with similar requirements adopted by other jurisdictions.(d) The department may by rule specify that "enter into commerce" includes the use of stockpiled refrigerants to replenish any leaks or otherwise service stationary equipment.(3)(a) The prohibitions established under this section do not apply to:(i) Hydrofluorocarbons that are reclaimed;(ii) An application receiving application-specific allowances under subsection (e)(B) of the American innovation and manufacturing act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 7675); or(iii) Transshipments of bulk virgin hydrofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbon blends.(b) For virgin bulk hydrofluorocarbon blends, the global warming potential limits of this section apply to the global warming potential of the blend and not to any individual component of such a blend.(4)(a) The department may provide for a temporary exemption for a virgin hydrofluorocarbon or a virgin hydrofluorocarbon blend where the department determines complying with a requirement of this section is technically or economically infeasible.(b) An exemption granted by the department under this subsection may not exceed three years and must be conditional upon the exemption recipient carrying out a plan, on an enforceable timeline, to meet the requirements of this section. Each exemption granted by the department shall end after three years unless, at least six months prior to the expiration of the exemption, the exemption recipient submits a request for extension with justification. The department may determine whether to renew or modify the exemption based on its review of the request for an extension.(5) A violation of the requirements of this section are subject to penalties as provided in chapter 70A.15 RCW.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3.
