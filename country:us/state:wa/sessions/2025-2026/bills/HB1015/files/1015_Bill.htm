The legislature finds that improving the energy efficiency of, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from, existing residential buildings, including detached single-family homes, is critical to meeting the state's climate goals. The legislature further finds that making information about energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions available to homebuyers will help homebuyers make more informed decisions and that this information will cause the market to better value the efficiency and the greenhouse gas impacts of energy consumed in a home. The legislature further finds that home energy labeling programs using the home energy score model developed by the United States department of energy have proven to be effective in other states.Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a method for energy labeling of existing residential buildings.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
