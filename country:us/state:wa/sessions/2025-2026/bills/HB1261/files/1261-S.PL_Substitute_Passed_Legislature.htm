As soon as possible, the assessor must compute the amount of additional tax, applicable interest, and penalty and the treasurer must mail notice to the owner of the amount thereof and the date on which payment is due. The amount of the additional tax, applicable interest, and penalty must be determined as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The amount of additional tax is ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">equal</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) Except as provided in (a)(ii) of this subsection, equal</span> to the difference between the property tax paid as "open space land," "farm and agricultural land," or "timberland" and the amount of property tax otherwise due and payable for the seven years last past had the land not been so classified;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) For removals, or withdrawals, of classified farm and agricultural land on or after September 1, 2025, equal to the difference between the property tax paid as farm and agricultural and the amount of property tax otherwise due and payable for the four years last past had the land not been so classified.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The amount of applicable interest is equal to the interest upon the amounts of the additional tax paid at the same statutory rate charged on delinquent property taxes from the dates on which the additional tax could have been paid without penalty if the land had been assessed at a value without regard to this chapter;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The amount of the penalty is as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.080'>84.34.080</a>. The penalty may not be imposed if the removal satisfies the conditions of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.070'>84.34.070</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Additional tax, applicable interest, and penalty become a lien on the land. The lien attaches at the time the land is removed from classification under this chapter and has priority to and must be fully paid and satisfied before any recognizance, mortgage, judgment, debt, obligation, or responsibility to or with which the land may become charged or liable. This lien may be foreclosed upon expiration of the same period after delinquency and in the same manner provided by law for foreclosure of liens for delinquent real property taxes as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.64.050'>84.64.050</a>. Any additional tax unpaid on the due date is delinquent as of the due date. From the date of delinquency until paid, interest must be charged at the same rate applied by law to delinquent ad valorem property taxes.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The additional tax, applicable interest, and penalty specified in subsection (4) of this section may not be imposed if the removal of classification pursuant to subsection (1) of this section resulted solely from:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Transfer to a government entity in exchange for other land located within the state of Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b)(i) A taking through the exercise of the power of eminent domain, or (ii) sale or transfer to an entity having the power of eminent domain in anticipation of the exercise of such power, said entity having manifested its intent in writing or by other official action;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A natural disaster such as a flood, windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, or other such calamity rather than by virtue of the act of the landowner changing the use of the property;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Official action by an agency of the state of Washington or by the county or city within which the land is located which disallows the present use of the land;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Transfer of land to a church when the land would qualify for exemption pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.36.020'>84.36.020</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Acquisition of property interests by state agencies or agencies or organizations qualified under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.34.210'>84.34.210</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.04.130'>64.04.130</a> for the purposes enumerated in those sections.

Examples of an independent basis for removal include the owner changing the use of the land or failing to meet any applicable income criteria required for classification under this chapter; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) The sale or transfer to a governmental entity if the governmental entity manages the land in the same manner as designated forestland under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=84.33'>84.33</a> RCW, or as property classified as timberland under this chapter, and the governmental entity provides the county assessor with a timber management plan or a notice of intent to manage the land as required under this subsection (6)(m). The governmental entity must provide an updated timberland or forestland management plan to the county assessor at least once every revaluation cycle. The county is authorized to collect a fee from the governmental entity for the filing of the forestland or timberland management plan in accordance with the county's fee schedule. When the land is not managed as required under this subsection (6)(m), or when the governmental entity sells or transfers the land at any time, the additional tax specified in subsection (4) of this section is due from the current government owner, unless the change in use of the land, sale or transfer, meets one of the other exceptions in this subsection (6).<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">This act does not affect any existing right acquired or liability or obligation incurred under the sections amended or repealed in this act or under any rule or order adopted under those sections, nor does it affect any proceeding instituted under those sections.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 5.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 6.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.32.805'>82.32.805</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.32.808'>82.32.808</a> do not apply to this act.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
