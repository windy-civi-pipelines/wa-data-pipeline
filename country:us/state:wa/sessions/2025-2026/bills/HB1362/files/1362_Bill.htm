The prosecutor may present the court with any evidence concerning whether the person committed the crime in furtherance or as a result of problem gambling or disordered gambling and the advisability of permitting the person to enter the program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) At the hearing, the court shall advise the person that sentencing will be postponed if the person submits to treatment and is accepted into a program for the treatment of problem gambling or disordered gambling. The court shall advise the person that:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The court may impose any conditions upon the treatment that could be imposed as conditions of probation; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the person is accepted in the program, the person may be placed under the supervision or care of a qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional for a period of at least one year or until the court, upon recommendation of the treatment provider, determines that the person has successfully completed the treatment program.

The judgment constitutes a lien in like manner as a judgment for money rendered in a civil action. If the person who is placed under the supervision of a qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional does not have the financial resources to pay all of the related costs:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The court shall, to the extent practicable, arrange for the person to be assigned to a program that receives a sufficient amount of federal or state funding to offset the remainder of the costs; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The court may order the person to perform supervised community service in lieu of paying the remainder of the costs relating to the person's treatment and supervision.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) A person who is afflicted with problem gambling or disordered gambling and who has pled guilty to or been convicted of a crime and who committed the crime in furtherance or as a result of problem gambling or a gambling disorder is eligible to be assigned by the court to a program for the treatment of problem gambling or disordered gambling before the person is sentenced unless:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The crime is:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A crime against persons established in Title <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7'>7</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9'>9</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A'>9A</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10'>10</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26'>26</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A'>28A</a>, <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46'>46</a>, or <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74'>74</a> RCW;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A crime against a child listed in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.400.322'>28A.400.322</a>; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) An act which constitutes domestic violence as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.99.020'>10.99.020</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The person has a record of two or more convictions of a crime described in (a) of this subsection or a similar crime in violation of the laws of another state or other criminal proceedings that allege the commission of a violent offense are pending against the person;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The person is on probation or parole, unless the appropriate probation or parole authority consents or the court finds that the person is eligible after considering any objections made by the appropriate probation or parole authority; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The person has previously been assigned by a court to a program for the treatment of problem gambling or disordered gambling.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6)(a) Whenever a person is placed under the supervision or care of a qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional, the person's sentencing must be deferred and the person's conviction must be set aside if the professional certifies to the court that the person has satisfactorily completed the program of treatment and the court approves the certification and determines that the conditions imposed for treatment have been satisfied.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) If the qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional has not certified that the person has completed the program of treatment prior to the expiration of the treatment period, the court shall sentence the person. If the person has satisfied the conditions imposed for treatment and the court believes that the person will complete the treatment voluntarily, the court may discharge the conviction. If, prior to the expiration of the treatment period, the qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional determines that the person will benefit from further treatment, the professional may request that the court extend the treatment period beyond three years.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) During the treatment period, if the qualified mental health or substance use disorder professional determines that the person is not likely to benefit from further treatment, the professional shall so advise the court. The court shall either:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Arrange for the transfer to a more suitable program; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Terminate the supervision and conduct a hearing to determine whether the person should be sentenced.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) If the person satisfactorily completes the treatment program, as determined by the court, the conviction may be discharged under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.637'>9.94A.637</a>. If the person does not satisfactorily complete treatment and satisfy the conditions, the court may impose a sentence that could have been imposed, or that would have been required to be imposed, originally for the offense for which the person pled guilty or was convicted. If the person's conviction is discharged, the person may apply to the court for a vacation of the offender's record of conviction under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.640'>9.94A.640</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) As used in this section:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) "Qualified mental health professional" means any mental health professional or mental health service agency as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.02.010'>70.02.010</a> that is licensed or certified by the department of health to provide problem gambling services.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) "Substance use disorder professional" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.97.010'>70.97.010</a>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
