While federal law permits states to adopt California's motor vehicle emission standards as an alternative to the federal standards, this remains optional. The legislature further finds that decarbonizing the transportation sector is achievable and an important objective in Washington state, but adopting California's standards limits flexibility in meeting Washington's unique needs and economy. For these reasons, the legislature determines that a more balanced approach is needed for Washington's transition to a carbon free transportation sector.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.30'>70A.30</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department of ecology shall adopt rules, which may be amended from time to time to remain compliant with federal law, to implement motor vehicle emission standards that maintain consistency with the federal clean air act, as it existed on the effective date of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, the department of ecology shall not adopt California's motor vehicle emission standards as authorized in 42 U.S.C.
