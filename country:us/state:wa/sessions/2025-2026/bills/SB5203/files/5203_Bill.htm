ï»¿S-0437.1SENATE BILL 5203State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Salomon, Shewmake, Cortes, Hasegawa, Liias, and NoblesPrefiled 01/09/25.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Transportation.AN ACT Relating to ensuring connectivity for Washington wildlife through safe passages; reenacting and amending RCW 43.84.092 and 43.84.092; adding a new section to chapter 47.04 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 77.36 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 46.68 RCW; adding a new section to chapter 77.04 RCW; creating a new section; providing an effective date; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that:(a) Vehicle collisions kill over 5,000 deer and 300 elk, hundreds of black bears, cougars, bobcats, and coyotes, and tens of thousands of small mammals and amphibians in Washington state per year. Such loss depletes the state's natural heritage, depriving residents of wildlife watching and hunting opportunities, and weakening ecosystem functions required to support human well-being;(b) Wildlife vehicle collisions with deer and elk alone cost Washington residents over $74,000,000 per year in lost work from injury, medical treatment, vehicle damage, emergency response, and insurance payouts. This does not include the cost of lost wildlife;(c) Human development and roads cause loss and fragmentation of habitat, reducing the total area and quality of habitat available to Washington state's wildlife populations, and impeding normal patterns of movement that wildlife need to meet their daily, seasonal, and long-term life history and population viability needs. For example, Washington state lost over 1.1 million acres of forestland to other uses between 1978 and 2019, and over 80 percent of shrub-steppe habitat has been lost since European settlement;(d) Climate change is already causing wildlife populations to shift home ranges in search of more suitable habitats. Fragmented landscapes with barriers to movement make it more difficult for wildlife to meet their normal needs and to adapt to climate change;(e) Preventing the loss of remaining intact landscape corridors and vulnerable core habitats is crucial for preventing large-scale loss of Washington's biological diversity;(f) The state of Washington and partners have built wildlife crossing structures over and under Interstate 90 and retrofitted one underpass on United States route 97. These structures have reduced wildlife-vehicle collisions by 90 percent in the areas near the crossing structures, showing that this is an effective method of improving wildlife habitat connectivity and public safety; and(g) The state of Washington has developed some of the best wildlife habitat connectivity science in the United States. The department of fish and wildlife, in consultation with the department of transportation, has begun to develop the Washington habitat connectivity action plan to synthesize that science and propose priority actions to protect habitat connectivity corridors and facilitate passage of wildlife across the state's highways.(2) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to direct the departments of fish and wildlife and transportation, in cooperation with other state agencies as needed, to identify and protect wildlife habitat connectivity corridors and build appropriate crossing structures to preserve the natural heritage of the state and to improve highway safety by reducing wildlife vehicle collisions.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 47.04 RCW to read as follows:(1) The department and the department of fish and wildlife shall develop an integrated strategy to implement and periodically update the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan developed by the department of fish and wildlife. In developing their integrated wildlife habitat connectivity strategy, the department and the department of fish and wildlife shall consult with tribal governments, federal agencies, and nongovernmental partners representing nonprofit conservation organizations and academia, for recommending funding strategies and priorities to the legislature, and developing agency budget requests.(2) The integrated wildlife habitat connectivity strategy should include the following objectives:(a) Help advance projects that provide safe passage for wildlife and the traveling public;(b) Enhance or maintain ecological connectivity for Washington's fish and wildlife species;(c) Bring together state and federal agencies, tribal governments, and a diverse cadre of nongovernmental partners that represent academia, nonprofit organizations, and biological and engineering sciences in the furtherance of this purpose; and(d) Establish a framework for prioritization, oversight, and funding recommendations related to implementing the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan developed by the department of fish and wildlife, and the utilization of funds in the Washington wildlife corridors and Washington wildlife crossings accounts in sections 3 and 4 of this act.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 77.36 RCW to read as follows:(1) The Washington wildlife corridors account is created in the state treasury. The account may receive moneys appropriated to the account from the general fund and the capital appropriations act and other funding sources as directed or appropriated by the legislature. Private donations may be made to the account. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation.(2) Expenditures from the account may be used for implementation of strategic activities that promote the protection and management of wildlife corridors as identified in the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan developed by the department pursuant to section 308(29), chapter 475, Laws of 2023 including, but not limited to:(a) The purchase of land or interest in land through voluntary conservation easements to protect habitat within key connectivity corridors guided by the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan developed by the department;(b) Landowner assistance programs including fencing removal and invasive weed control and other habitat restoration activities within corridors;(c) Required updates under sections 2 and 5 of this act to the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan; and(d) Department administrative and personnel staffing needs for implementation of the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan.(3) Biennial spending plans shall be developed consistently with the integrated wildlife habitat connectivity strategy directed in section 2 of this act.(4) Beginning in 2026, the department of transportation and the department of fish and wildlife shall jointly report by June 30th of each even-numbered year, in accordance with RCW 43.01.036, to the appropriate committees of the legislature, the governor's office, and the fish and wildlife commission on expenditures from the account and how the expenditures have furthered implementation of the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan; and additional funding necessary to accomplish the goals of the Washington wildlife habitat connectivity action plan, including estimates for agency staffing needs, matching funds for federal grant opportunities, and other allowable expenditures specified in this section and section 4 of this act.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4.
