TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as follows:WHEREAS, The scientific consensus is clear that human activities are primarily responsible for accelerating global climate change, and that the climate crisis now represents one of the preeminent threats to global civilization; andWHEREAS, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that we must achieve net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century in order to have a reasonable chance of limiting catastrophic levels of global warming; andWHEREAS, Changes in Washington's climate are already being felt, with examples of heat dome, wildfire, drought, sea level rise, flooding, changes in the hydropower system, and impacts on salmon including treaty rights and obligations; andWHEREAS, Our entire society will be impacted by the health and safety risks of fossil fuel expansion, particularly those who also face socioeconomic and health inequities, including low-income families, those experiencing homelessness, people of color and Indigenous people, youth, seniors, those experiencing mental and physical disabilities, and people with health conditions; andWHEREAS, Our youth and future generations have the most to lose from a lack of immediate action to stop fossil fuel expansion as they face major and lifelong health, ecological, social, and economic impacts from prolonged and cumulative effects of climate change, including food and water shortages, infectious diseases, and natural disasters; andWHEREAS, The Paris Climate Agreement is silent on coal, oil, and gas, an omission with respect to the supply and production of fossil fuels (the most significant source of climate altering pollution) that needs to be collectively addressed by other means; andWHEREAS, Our planet is on track to warm by 3.1 degrees Celsius unless governments undertake more significant efforts to limit climate pollution; andWHEREAS, The construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and expanded reliance on fossil fuels exposes communities to untenable risks to public health and safety at the local and global levels; andWHEREAS, The economic opportunities presented by a clean energy transition far outweigh the opportunities presented by an economy supported by expanding fossil fuel use and extraction; andWHEREAS, The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty has been formally called for by 16 nation-states, the European Parliament, the Vatican, and more than 125 cities and subnational governments globally, including the Washington city of Yakima, as well as the Hawaii, California, and Maine State Legislatures; andWHEREAS, The Washington State Legislature is committed to a just energy transition and to ambitious investments in the green infrastructure and industries that will create jobs and rapidly decarbonize our economy; andWHEREAS, The Washington State Legislature recognizes that it is the urgent responsibility and moral obligation of wealthy fossil fuel producers to lead in putting an end to fossil fuel development and to manage the decline of existing production; andWHEREAS, In 2019, the Washington State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 5145 which prohibits the use of hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas exploration within Washington; andWHEREAS, In 2020, the Washington State Legislature passed Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2311, committing to science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions, requiring incremental progress toward net zero emissions by 2050; andWHEREAS, In 2021, the Washington State Legislature passed the Climate Commitment Act which creates a market mechanism to cap emissions of climate pollution, reduce emissions steadily over time to achieve our science-based targets, and invest revenue in solutions; andWHEREAS, In 2021, the Washington State Legislature passed the HEAL Act, Engrossed Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 5141, to reduce environmental and health disparities in Washington, including disparities caused by climate change; andWHEREAS, In 2024, the people of Washington State reaffirmed their resolve to continue to pursue ambitious action to mitigate the climate crisis by roundly rejecting Initiative 2117 that would have repealed the Climate Commitment Act; andWHEREAS, The Washington State Legislature supports the new global initiative calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty that would end new fossil fuel exploration and expansion, phase out existing production in line with the global commitment to limit warming as much as possible, and accelerate equitable transition plans; andWHEREAS, The Washington State Legislature affirms its ongoing commitment to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement and the greenhouse gas reduction targets as called for by the intergovernmental panel on climate change, and pledges to meet its proportionate greenhouse gas reductions under the Paris Climate Agreement and Engrossed Second Substitute House Bill No. 2311;NOW, THEREFORE, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that the United States government join the global community in formally developing a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty as an international mechanism to manage a global transition away from coal, oil, and gas.BE IT RESOLVED, That the Legislature formally endorses the call for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty.BE IT RESOLVED, That Washington State agrees with the principle of the nonproliferation of fossil fuels and the need to end the expansion of new coal, oil, and gas production.BE IT RESOLVED, That Washington State affirms the need for a plan to phase out existing fossil fuel production that prioritizes the most impacted workers and local government services with short-term and long-term investments that include enforceable labor standards, such as prevailing wages, apprenticeship opportunities, and project labor agreements, to protect workers and communities.BE IT RESOLVED, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the Governor of the State of Washington, the United Nations Secretary-General, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington.--- END ---
