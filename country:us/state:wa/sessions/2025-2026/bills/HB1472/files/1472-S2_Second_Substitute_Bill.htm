ï»¿H-2205.1SECOND SUBSTITUTE HOUSE BILL 1472State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByHouse Appropriations (originally sponsored by Representative Ormsby; by request of Office of Financial Management)READ FIRST TIME 04/08/25.AN ACT Relating to closing the Yakima Valley school and Rainier school; amending RCW 71A.20.020, 28A.190.005, 72.01.050, and 72.05.010; adding a new section to chapter 71A.20 RCW; creating new sections; repealing RCW 71A.20.180; providing an effective date; and declaring an emergency.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that:(1) The system of services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities should provide a balanced range of health, social, and supportive services at home or in other residential settings. The receipt of services should be coordinated so as to minimize administrative cost and service duplication, and eliminate unnecessarily complex system organization.(2) Residential habilitation centers exist to provide a safe place to live and appropriate supports to learn the skills needed to live with as much self-determination and independence as possible, including moving to a community-based setting if so desired.(3) Residential habilitation centers should promote individual dignity, autonomy, and a home-like environment.(4) The state has made efforts towards shrinking the residential habilitation centers, particularly at Rainier school and Yakima Valley school, in recent years. The department of social and health services has thoughtfully and successfully transitioned many of the residents at residential habilitation centers into smaller supported settings. The legislature finds that this has been successful because of intentional efforts to honor personal choice, deliberate and transparent work with residents, families, and staff, and expanding supported living and state-operated living alternative settings. It has also been successful when the state makes these transitions over specific and sensible periods of time to allow for safe transition to individually tailored supports.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 71A.20 RCW to read as follows:(1) By June 30, 2027, the department shall close Yakima Valley school and Rainier school and relocate current residents consistent with the requirements of subsections (2) through (4) of this section.(2) Upon the effective date of this section, the department shall not permit any new admission to Yakima Valley school or Rainier school unless such admission is limited to the provision of short-term respite or crisis stabilization services.(3) Within available funds, the department:(a) Shall provide state-operated living alternatives to residential habilitation center residents transitioning to the community under chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 (this act) who prefer a state-operated community residential service;(b) May use existing supported living program capacity in the community for former residential habilitation center residents who prefer and choose a supported living program;(c) Shall provide space at other residential habilitation centers to those who prefer a residential habilitation center setting; and(d) Shall offer residential habilitation center employees opportunities to work in state-operated living alternatives and other state facilities and programs.(4) When transitioning individuals affected by the closures required in subsection (1) of this section the department shall, within available funds:(a) Offer each individual resident a meaningful choice of alternative placements;(b) Prioritize client choice, autonomy, individual preferences, medical and behavioral health care needs, and opportunities for community integration;(c) Develop individualized transition plans in collaboration with each resident and their family or legal guardian, caregivers, and support providers;(d) Coordinate closely with other state agencies, local entities, health care providers, and community stakeholders to ensure seamless transitions;(e) Provide or contract for all necessary assessments, planning, relocation expenses, housing modifications, staff training, crisis support, and related transition activities; and(f) Implement robust oversight and accountability measures related to the transitions, and regularly monitor transition outcomes, as well as individual well-being and satisfaction.(5) Following the closure of Yakima Valley school as required in subsection (1) of this section, the facility must thereafter operate crisis stabilization beds and only so many respite service beds as the needs of the department-identified catchment area or as emergency placement needs require, subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose.Sec. 3.
