The department of social and health services has thoughtfully and successfully transitioned many of the residents at residential habilitation centers into smaller supported settings. The legislature finds that this has been successful because of intentional efforts to honor personal choice, deliberate and transparent work with residents, families, and staff, and expanding supported living and state-operated living alternative settings. It has also been successful when the state makes these transitions over specific and sensible periods of time to allow for safe transition to individually tailored supports.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.20'>71A.20</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By June 30, 2027, the department shall close Yakima Valley school and Rainier school and relocate current residents consistent with the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Upon the effective date of this section, the department shall not permit any new admission to Yakima Valley school or Rainier school unless such admission is limited to the provision of short-term respite or crisis stabilization services.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Within available funds, the department:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Shall provide state-operated living alternatives to residential habilitation center residents transitioning to the community under chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 (this act) who prefer a state-operated community residential service;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) May use existing supported living program capacity in the community for former residential habilitation center residents who prefer and choose a supported living program;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Shall provide space at other residential habilitation centers to those who prefer a residential habilitation center setting;
