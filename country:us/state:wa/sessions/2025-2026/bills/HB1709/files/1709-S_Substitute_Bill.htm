Legislation enacted in 2013 authorized parent-designated adults to provide care for students with seizure disorders, including epilepsy.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature finds that adrenal insufficiency is a rare condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. If cortisol levels drop too low, which can happen when a person is stressed, ill, or injured, a person will experience abdominal pain, fatigue, dizziness, and ultimately go into shock. Acute severe adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening situation that requires emergency treatment with cortisol or similar medication to prevent shock or other severe complications.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Therefore, the legislature intends to authorize parent-designated adults to provide care for students with adrenal insufficiency. </div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.210'>28A.210</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) School districts shall provide individual health plans for students with adrenal insufficiency, subject to the following conditions:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The board of directors of the school district shall adopt and periodically revise policies governing the care of students with adrenal insufficiency.
