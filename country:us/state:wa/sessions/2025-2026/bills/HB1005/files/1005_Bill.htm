ï»¿H-0018.1HOUSE BILL 1005State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Ryu, Corry, and ReevesPrefiled 12/03/24.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Consumer Protection & Business.AN ACT Relating to prearrangement funeral services; amending RCW 18.39.010 and 18.39.250; and creating a new section.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1.
