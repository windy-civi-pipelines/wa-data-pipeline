Days spent in the custody of the department shall be tolled by any period of time during which a juvenile has absented himself or herself from the department's supervision without the prior approval of the secretary or the secretary's designee.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The secretary shall monitor the average daily population of the state's juvenile residential facilities. When the secretary concludes that in-residence population of residential facilities exceeds ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">one hundred five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">105</span> percent of the rated bed capacity specified in statute, or in absence of such specification, as specified by the department in rule, the secretary may recommend reductions to the governor. On certification by the governor that the recommended reductions are necessary, the secretary has authority to administratively release a sufficient number of offenders to reduce in-residence population to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">one hundred</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">100</span> percent of rated bed capacity. The secretary shall release those offenders who have served the greatest proportion of their sentence. However, the secretary may deny release in a particular case at the request of an offender, or if the secretary finds that there is no responsible custodian, as determined by the department, to whom to release the offender, or if the release of the offender would pose a clear danger to society. The department shall notify the committing court of the release at the time of release if any such early releases have occurred as a result of excessive in-residence population. In no event shall an offender adjudicated of a violent offense be granted release under the provisions of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3)(a) Following the release of any juvenile under subsection (1) of this section, the secretary may require the juvenile to comply with a program of parole to be administered by the department in his or her community which shall last no longer than ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">eighteen</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">18</span> months, except that in the case of a juvenile sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.030'>9.94A.030</a> the period of parole shall be ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-four</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">24</span> months and, in the discretion of the secretary, may be up to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty-six</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">36</span> months when the secretary finds that an additional period of parole is necessary and appropriate in the interests of public safety or to meet the ongoing needs of the juvenile. A parole program is mandatory for offenders released under subsection (2) of this section and for offenders who receive a juvenile residential commitment sentence for theft of a motor vehicle, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">attempting to elude a police vehicle,</span> or taking a motor vehicle without permission 1. A juvenile adjudicated for unlawful possession of a firearm, possession of a stolen firearm, theft of a firearm, or drive-by shooting may participate in aggression replacement training, functional family therapy, or functional family parole aftercare if the juvenile meets eligibility requirements for these services. The decision to place an offender in an evidence-based parole program shall be based on an assessment by the department of the offender's risk for reoffending upon release and an assessment of the ongoing treatment needs of the juvenile. The department shall prioritize available parole resources to provide supervision and services to offenders at moderate to high risk for reoffending.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The secretary shall, for the period of parole, facilitate the juvenile's reintegration into his or her community and to further this goal shall require the juvenile to refrain from possessing a firearm or using a deadly weapon, and refrain from committing new offenses or violating any orders issued by the juvenile court pursuant to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105'>7.105</a> RCW, and may require the juvenile to: (i) Undergo available medical, psychiatric, drug and alcohol, sex offender, mental health, and other offense-related treatment services; (ii) report as directed to a parole officer and/or designee; (iii) pursue a course of study, vocational training, or employment; (iv) notify the parole officer of the current address where he or she resides; (v) be present at a particular address during specified hours; (vi) remain within prescribed geographical boundaries; (vii) submit to electronic monitoring; (viii) refrain from using illegal drugs and alcohol, and submit to random urinalysis when requested by the assigned parole officer; (ix) refrain from contact with specific individuals or a specified class of individuals; (x) meet other conditions determined by the parole officer to further enhance the juvenile's reintegration into the community; (xi) pay any court-ordered fines or restitution; and (xii) perform community restitution.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(A)</span> Community restitution for the purpose of this section means compulsory service, without compensation, performed for the benefit of the community by the offender. Community restitution may be performed through public or private organizations or through work crews.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(B) The department shall require any juvenile adjudicated guilty for attempting to elude a police vehicle to submit to electronic monitoring for the duration of the term of the parole program.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The secretary may further require up to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">25</span> percent of the highest risk juvenile offenders who are placed on parole to participate in an intensive supervision program. Offenders participating in an intensive supervision program shall be required to comply with all terms and conditions listed in (b) of this subsection and shall also be required to comply with the following additional terms and conditions: (i) Obey all laws and refrain from any conduct that threatens public safety; (ii) report at least once a week to an assigned community case manager; and (iii) meet all other requirements imposed by the community case manager related to participating in the intensive supervision program. As a part of the intensive supervision program, the secretary may require day reporting.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) After termination of the parole period, the juvenile shall be discharged from the department's supervision.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4)(a) The department may also modify parole for violation thereof. If, after affording a juvenile all of the due process rights to which he or she would be entitled if the juvenile were an adult, the secretary finds that a juvenile has violated a condition of his or her parole, the secretary shall order one of the following which is reasonably likely to effectuate the purpose of the parole and to protect the public: (i) Continued supervision under the same conditions previously imposed; (ii) intensified supervision with increased reporting requirements; (iii) additional conditions of supervision authorized by this chapter; (iv) except as provided in (a)(v) and (vi) of this subsection, imposition of a period of confinement not to exceed ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state of Washington or any city or county for a portion of each day or for a certain number of days each week with the balance of the days or weeks spent under supervision; (v) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the offense for which the offender was sentenced is rape in the first or second degree, rape of a child in the first or second degree, child molestation in the first degree, indecent liberties with forcible compulsion, or a sex offense that is also a serious violent offense as defined by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.030'>9.94A.030</a>; and (vi) the secretary may order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for the remainder of the sentence range if the youth has completed the basic training camp program as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.40.320'>13.40.320</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The secretary may modify parole and order any of the conditions or may return the offender to confinement for up to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-four</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">24</span> weeks if the offender was sentenced for a sex offense as defined under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.128'>9A.44.128</a> and is known to have violated the terms of parole. Confinement beyond ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days is intended to only be used for a small and limited number of sex offenders. It shall only be used when other graduated sanctions or interventions have not been effective or the behavior is so egregious it warrants the use of the higher level intervention and the violation: (i) Is a known pattern of behavior consistent with a previous sex offense that puts the youth at high risk for reoffending sexually; (ii) consists of sexual behavior that is determined to be predatory as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.020'>71.09.020</a>; or (iii) requires a review under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09'>71.09</a> RCW, due to a recent overt act. The total number of days of confinement for violations of parole conditions during the parole period shall not exceed the number of days provided by the maximum sentence imposed by the disposition for the underlying offense pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.40.0357'>13.40.0357</a>. The department shall not aggregate multiple parole violations that occur prior to the parole revocation hearing and impose consecutive ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-four</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">24</span> week periods of confinement for each parole violation. The department is authorized to engage in rule making pursuant to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=34.05'>34.05</a> RCW, to implement this subsection, including narrowly defining the behaviors that could lead to this higher level intervention.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) If the department finds that any juvenile in a program of parole has possessed a firearm or used a deadly weapon during the program of parole, the department shall modify the parole under (a) of this subsection and confine the juvenile for at least ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days. Confinement shall be in a facility operated by or pursuant to a contract with the state or any county.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) A parole officer of the department of children, youth, and families shall have the power to arrest a juvenile under his or her supervision on the same grounds as a law enforcement officer would be authorized to arrest the person.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) If so requested and approved under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.06'>13.06</a> RCW, the secretary shall permit a county or group of counties to perform functions under subsections (3) through (5) of this section.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 13.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">Sections 7 and 9 of this act expire January 1, 2026.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 14.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">Sections 8 and 10 of this act take effect January 1, 2026.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
