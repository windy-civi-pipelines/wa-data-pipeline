The legislature further finds that the use of solar energy to power buildings is generally a cost-effective means of reducing energy bills with a return on investment that may equal or exceed the initial cost. The legislature also notes that the state's building code requires solar readiness for many buildings and that the state's energy performance standard, commonly known as the clean buildings act, is transitioning the state toward ever more energy efficient buildings. Considering these benefits and existing state requirements, the legislature intends to create a requirement, subject to sufficient legislative appropriations, that public schools install solar energy systems on new buildings that exceed 50,000 square feet.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.525'>28A.525</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) A public school that plans to commence construction of a qualifying school building on or after June 1, 2028, shall notify the office of the superintendent of public instruction prior to the commencement of construction in order to address the feasibility of installing a qualifying solar energy system.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A public school that plans to commence construction of a qualifying school building on or after June 1, 2025, but prior to June 1, 2028, may provide notice to the superintendent of public instruction pursuant to subsection (2) of this section for the purpose of seeking a grant award under section 3 of this act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The notification required by subsection (1) of this section must be provided within the time frame established by the superintendent of public instruction and must include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The estimated cost of permitting, purchasing, and installing a qualifying solar energy system for the planned building; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A comparison of the proposed qualifying solar energy system's capacity to the school campus' anticipated electrical energy consumption.
