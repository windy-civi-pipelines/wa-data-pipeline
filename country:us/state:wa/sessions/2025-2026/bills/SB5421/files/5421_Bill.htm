In Washington, small businesses make up 99.5 percent of all businesses and employ over 1,400,000 individuals, representing 49 percent of the state's workforce. Businesses that serve families, such as early learning, child care and education programs, and those that create community spaces, like neighborhood cafÃ©s, are critical to building strong social ties and vibrant, walkable neighborhoods that enhance residents' quality of life. Allowing certain small businesses to operate in residential zones can strengthen community bonds, support families, reduce emissions, and promote local employment and entrepreneurship. This legislation encourages cities and towns to facilitate the establishment of compatible small businesses within residential areas, contributing to vibrant, resilient neighborhoods while preserving their character and livability.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.21'>35.21</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A city or town must allow neighborhood businesses to be permitted in any zone allowing residential uses, provided that the following conditions are met:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The total gross floor area of the neighborhood business does not exceed the maximum limits specified in the definition of neighborhood business in subsection (3) of this section; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The neighborhood business does not include drive through facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Cities and towns may adopt regulations governing the following aspects of neighborhood businesses to ensure compatibility with surrounding residential areas, including reasonable limits related to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The hours of operation, as long as at least 12 hours of continuous operation is allowed, to minimize noise and disruption during nighttime hours, except as it relates to early care and education programs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Mitigation of noise levels, including soundproofing, amplified music, and outdoor activities during certain hours;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The size, type, and placement of signage to prevent visual clutter and maintain the aesthetic character of the neighborhood;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The timing and routing of deliveries to minimize traffic congestion and noise associated with freight activities;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Neighborhood businesses located on a street or in an area where there is more than one means of egress for vehicle traffic to minimize congestion and ensure safety; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The sale and consumption of alcohol by neighborhood businesses, provided that such regulations do not impact businesses operating with existing licenses or permits for the sale of alcohol.
