The committee must also consider the feasibility and requirements of developing a shared database, including how the department of health could use existing tools, such as the tracking network, to better display multiagency data regarding pesticides. The committee may also evaluate and recommend policy options that would take action to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Improve pesticide application safety with agricultural applications;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Lead an effort to establish baseline data for the type and quantity of pesticide applications used in Washington to be able to compare the number of exposures with overall number of applications;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Research ways to improve pesticide application communication among different members of the agricultural community, including educating the public in English and Spanish about acute and chronic health information about pesticides;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Compile industry's best practices for use to improve pesticide application safety to limit pesticide exposure;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Continue to investigate reasons why members of the agricultural workforce do not or may not report pesticide exposure;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Explore new avenues for reporting with investigation without fear of retaliation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Work with stakeholders to consider trainings for how and when to report;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Explore incentives for using new technology by funding a partial buy-out program for old spray technology;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Consider developing an effective community health education plan;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) Consult with community partners to enhance educational initiatives that work with the agricultural workforce, their families, and surrounding communities to reduce the risk of pesticide exposure;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) Enhance efforts to work with pesticide manufacturers and the environmental protection agency to improve access to non-English pesticide labeling in the United States;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) Work with research partners to develop, or promote the use of translation apps for pesticide label safety information, or both;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) Evaluate prevention techniques to minimize exposure events;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(n) Develop more Spanish language and other language educational materials for distribution, including through social media and app-based learning for agricultural workforce communities;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(o) Explore development of an agricultural workforce education safety program to improve the understanding about leaving an area being sprayed; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(p) Work with the industry and the agricultural workforce to improve protocols and best practices for use of personal safety equipment for applicators and reflective gear for the general workforce.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The committee must provide a report to the appropriate committees of the legislature by May 1, 2020, and each year thereafter.

The bill recognized that farmers, farmworkers, and the broader community share an interest in minimizing human exposure to pesticides. It also recognized that gains have been made in reducing human exposure to pesticides and that collaboration between state agencies and the farming community could further reduce agricultural workers exposure to pesticide drift.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislation established a pesticide application safety work group that would make recommendations for improving pesticide application safety. Work group members included legislators from both chambers and caucuses, as well as representation from state agencies and the commission on Hispanic affairs. The work group sought public participation to learn more about pesticide application safety. Many stakeholders including but not limited to local farm hosts, the agricultural industry, and members of the agricultural workforce contributed valuable assistance and input.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The work group reached two noteworthy recommendations regarding what can be done now to improve pesticide application safety. The recommendations are to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Expand training because the department of agriculture lacks sufficient resources to meet the training demand from pesticide applicators and handlers; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Establish a new pesticide application safety panel to provide an opportunity to evaluate and recommend policy options, and investigate exposure cases.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The work group concluded that legislation is warranted to expand funding for a training program and set up a new pesticide application safety panel with clear objectives.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) This section expires July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2025</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2035</span>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">If specific funding for the purposes of this act, referencing this act by bill or chapter number, is not provided by June 30, 2025, in the omnibus appropriations act, this act is null and void.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect July 1, 2025.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
