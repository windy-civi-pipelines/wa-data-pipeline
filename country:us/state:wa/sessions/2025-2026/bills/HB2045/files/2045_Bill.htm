The legislature finds that funding education, public safety, health care, and basic human needs helps Washington succeed and thrive. The state's paramount duty is to provide every child with an education, thereby creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. To promote and improve public safety, the state funds the basic law enforcement academy to train and certify every peace officer in the state. The state invests in health care programs that deliver critical, life-saving services, and protect the well-being of the public. The state also supports vital basic needs assistance to the state's lowest-income households, educates the youngest learners, and strengthens food security for seniors.Therefore, the legislature intends to levy an incremental surcharge on the gross revenue of the state's highest earning businesses and amend the surcharge on the gross revenue of large financial institutions to meet the state's obligation to provide adequate funding for K-12 education, public safety, health care, and other human service investments. The legislature finds the levying of this tax is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and itsÂ existingÂ publicÂ institutions.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 82.04 RCW to read as follows:(1) Beginning January 1, 2026, in addition to all other taxes imposed under this chapter, persons must pay a surcharge on Washington taxable income over $250,000,000 in a calendar year.(2) The rate of the tax is one percent of the amount of Washington taxable income over $250,000,000.(3)(a) Any Washington taxable income subject to the tax in RCW 82.04.29004 is exempt from the surcharge imposed in this section.(b)(i) Any Washington taxable income subject to the manufacturing tax rates in RCW 82.04.240, 82.04.2404, 82.04.241, 82.04.260, 82.04.2602, 82.04.287, 82.04.2909, or 82.04.294(1) is exempt from the surcharge imposed in this section.(ii) Any Washington taxable income attributable to the wholesale or retail sale of products so manufactured by a person subject to the manufacturing tax rates specified in (b)(i) of this subsection (3) is exempt from the surcharge imposed in this section.(4)(a) The surcharge imposed under this section does not apply to taxable income for which a credit is allowed under RCW 82.04.440.(b) The surcharge imposed under this section does not apply to a person engaged in business primarily as a farmer or eligible apiarist as defined in RCW 82.04.213.(5) Any income that is exempt from the surcharge imposed under this section is not included in the calculation of Washington taxable income in subsection (1) of this section.Sec. 3.

A person failing to comply with this subsection is deemed to have intended to evade tax payable under this section and is subject to the penalty in RCW 82.32.090(7) on any tax due under this section by the person and any financial institution affiliated with the person.(5) Taxes collected under this section must be deposited into the general fund.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4.
