The legislature finds that people were told that a repeal of the climate commitment act would devastate transportation and infrastructure programs, putting major road and bridge projects at risk of delay or even cancellation. Yet, the climate commitment act prohibits the use of auction revenues for funding major road and bridge projects. The legislature recognizes that public transit and zero emissions vehicles travel on roads. Congestion on the highway system increases greenhouse gas emissions, instead of reducing them. Therefore, the legislature finds to respect the will of the voters and honor statements made to the people, climate commitment act revenues are appropriately used for road and bridge projects.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65'>70A.65</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Revenues derived under this act must be used on major highway projects and bridge replacements including, but not limited to, funding to replace the Interstate 5 bridge over the Columbia river; finish the US 395 North Spokane corridor; finish the state route number 520 bridge; and the Gateway freight project connecting state route number 509 and state route number 167 to the ports in Pierce county and King county to help move freight and reduce congestion.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.100'>70A.65.100</a> and 2024 c 352 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Except as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.110'>70A.65.110</a>,  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.120'>70A.65.120</a>, and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.130'>70A.65.130</a>, the department shall distribute allowances through auctions as provided in this section and in rules adopted by the department to implement these sections.
