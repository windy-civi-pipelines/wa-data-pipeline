As of the end of 2023, there was a minimum of 260 wolves in 42 packs across the state, demonstrating a sustained recovery of the species.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds that the United States fish and wildlife service, after an extensive peer-reviewed assessment using the best available science, announced in February 2024, a "not warranted" finding for petitions to list gray wolves under the endangered species act in the eastern third of Washington. This determination highlights the species' strong recovery and resilience in the region.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature finds that as gray wolves continue to disperse across Washington, there is a need for an incremental, localized approach to management. Regional differences in wolf populations require tailored management strategies that address specific ecological and community needs. An incremental, localized policy aligns with the state's recovery goals while balancing the ecological benefits of a thriving wolf population with the priorities of rural communities. Rural communities seek to balance environmental stewardship with other priorities, such as assuring a diversified economy that includes ranching and the protection of the public, livestock, and domestic household pets.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, the legislature intends to provide localized management of gray wolves in Washington, reflecting their sustained population growth and the findings of federal and state wildlife agencies. This policy will maintain protections for the species while providing the necessary tools for effective and science-based management, ensuring the continued recovery of gray wolves and coexistence with human communities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.01'>36.01</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department of fish and wildlife shall manage the gray wolf as if it has been removed from state designation as endangered under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.12.020'>77.12.020</a> within any county where the gray wolf is not designated under the federal endangered species act as threatened or endangered in the county or portion of the county and the following criteria are met:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The state meets the recovery objective of 15 breeding pairs in the state for at least three years; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) There are at least three documented breeding pairs in the county or portion of the county where the gray wolf is not designated under the federal endangered species act as threatened or endangered.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) When the criteria identified in subsection (1) of this section are met, the legislative body of the county must provide notice to the fish and wildlife commission and to the director of the department of fish and wildlife that the gray wolf no longer meets the criteria for state designation as endangered under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.12.020'>77.12.020</a> in that county.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) After a county acts under subsection (2) of this section, the county must enter into an interlocal agreement with the department of fish and wildlife and any tribes within the jurisdiction to collaboratively comanage the gray wolf in accordance with a regional plan developed pursuant to section 3 of this act, including collaborating with local law enforcement to receive and investigate reports of problem animals.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=77.36'>77.36</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Once a county acts under section 2(2) of this act, the department shall form a work group to develop a regional plan for gray wolf management in the county or portion of the county that meets the criteria in section 2(2) of this act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Members of the work group must include representatives of county cattlepersons organizations, representatives of county governments, a representative from a regional nonprofit organization that operates range riding and other year-round wolf and livestock conflict avoidance tactics in northeast Washington, and a representative from a conservation nonprofit.
