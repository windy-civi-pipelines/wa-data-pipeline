Ensuring the safety and unimpeded access of individuals entering and exiting places of worship is therefore a compelling government interest and essential for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, and safety. Toward that end, this chapter is aimed at making unlawful conduct that would interfere with a person's lawful exercise of that person's religious freedom under the state Constitution and United States Constitution. The legislature further finds that the protection of such persons from such interference can be accomplished without infringing on constitutionally protected speech or activity and affirms that its intent is to not seek to favor one viewpoint over another or to limit speech regarding any specific topic.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Aggrieved person" means any of the following:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A person, physically present at the premises of a place of worship when the prohibited actions occur, whose access to the premises is or is about to be obstructed or impeded;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A person, physically present at the premises of a place of worship when the prohibited actions occur, whose exercise of their freedom of religion is or is about to be disrupted;
