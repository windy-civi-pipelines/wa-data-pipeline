For learning to occur, schools must first be safe places for students and staff. The legislature recognizes that violent behavior tends to escalate if tolerated, thus it is the intent of the legislature to provide targeted and appropriate sanctions for the interference with school activities by force or violence before it rises to the level of substantial or grievous bodily harm.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature understands that extracurricular athletics provide valuable opportunities for students to develop social and personal skills that can be useful throughout their lives. These activities also benefit other students and spectators by building school spirit, unity, community support, and community identity. Extracurricular athletics would not be possible without the commitment of officials, judges, referees, and volunteers who work at the events for little or no financial gain. The legislature finds that the values engendered in interscholastic activities are being undermined by participants and spectators who do not respect the commitment of these officials. Increasingly, these people are expressing their dissatisfaction through inappropriate verbal abuse and behavior directed at the officials. The legislature recognizes that officials, such as judges and referees, and volunteers acting as officials, for extracurricular athletic activities of elementary and secondary school students are particularly vulnerable to inappropriate conduct because their attention is focused on the athletic activities. Thus, the legislature intends to provide additional support and protection for officials conducting interscholastic events.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature finds that violence against public and private students and staff is unacceptable. Thus, to promote a safe learning environment, the legislature intends to increase the penalty for those who deliberately ignore posted warnings against acts of intimidation or violence against school athletic officials.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635'>28A.635</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Signage must be posted notifying the public of the offenses and possible penalties under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635.090'>28A.635.090</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635.100'>28A.635.100</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The signage must be prominently displayed at any entrance to a public school gymnasium or auditorium and wherever other public notices are placed at public school athletic fields.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall develop a standard signage form notifying the public of the offenses and possible penalties under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635.090'>28A.635.090</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635.100'>28A.635.100</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) As used in this section, "public school" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.150.010'>28A.150.010</a>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.635.090'>28A.635.090</a> and 2003 c 53 s 169 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">shall be</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">is</span> unlawful for any person, singly or in concert with others, to interfere by force or violence with ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">any administrator, teacher, classified employee, person under contract with the school or school district, or student of any common school who</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">an employee or contractor of a public or private elementary or secondary school, an elementary or secondary student, or an official or volunteer acting as an official for extracurricular athletic activities of elementary or secondary students, while that person</span> is in the peaceful discharge or conduct of his or her duties or studies.
