Parties, attorneys, and witnesses may electronically sign sworn statements in all filings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The petitioner and the respondent must disclose the existence of any other litigation or of any other restraining, protection, or no-contact orders between the parties, to the extent that such information is known by the petitioner and the respondent. To the extent possible, the court shall take judicial notice of any existing restraining, protection, or no-contact orders between the parties before entering a protection order. The court shall not include provisions in a protection order that would allow the respondent to engage in conduct that is prohibited by another restraining, protection, or no-contact order between the parties that was entered in a different proceeding. The obligation to disclose the existence of any other litigation includes, but is not limited to, the existence of any other litigation concerning the custody or residential placement of a child of the parties as set forth in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.27.281'>26.27.281</a>.

The court shall not defer acting on a petition for a protection order nor grant a petitioner less than the full relief that the petitioner is otherwise entitled to under this chapter because there is, or could be, another proceeding involving the parties including, but not limited to, any potential or pending family law matter or criminal matter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) A person's right to petition for relief under this chapter is not affected by the person leaving his or her residence or household.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) A petitioner is not required to post a bond to obtain relief in any proceeding for a protection order.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9)(a) No fees for service of process may be charged by a court or any public agency to petitioners seeking relief under this chapter. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, courts may not charge petitioners any fees or surcharges the payment of which is a condition precedent to the petitioner's ability to secure access to relief under this chapter. Petitioners shall be provided the necessary number of certified copies, forms, and instructional brochures free of charge, including a copy of the service packet that consists of all documents that are being served on the respondent. A respondent who is served electronically with a protection order shall be provided a certified copy of the order free of charge upon request.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A filing fee may be charged for a petition for an antiharassment protection order except as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) No filing fee may be charged to a petitioner seeking an antiharassment protection order against a person who has engaged in acts of stalking as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.46.110'>9A.46.110</a>, a hate crime under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.36.080'>9A.36.080</a>(1)(c), or a single act of violence or threat of violence under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105.010'>7.105.010</a>((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(36)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(37)</span>(b), or from a person who has engaged in nonconsensual sexual conduct or penetration or conduct that would constitute a sex offense as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.128'>9A.44.128</a>, or from a person who is a family or household member or intimate partner who has engaged in conduct that would constitute domestic violence; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The court shall waive the filing fee if the court determines the petitioner is not able to pay the costs of filing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) If the petition states that disclosure of the petitioner's address or other identifying location information would risk harm to the petitioner or any member of the petitioner's family or household, that address may be omitted from all documents filed with the court. If the petitioner has not disclosed an address under this subsection, the petitioner shall designate an alternative address or email address at which the respondent may serve the petitioner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, or as provided through alternative sources including, but not limited to, grants, local funding, or pro bono means, if the court deems it necessary, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a petitioner or a respondent who is under 18 years of age and who is not represented by counsel. If a guardian ad litem is appointed by the court for either or both parties, neither the petitioner nor the respondent shall be required by the court to pay any costs associated with the appointment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) If a petitioner has requested an ex parte temporary protection order, because these are often emergent situations, the court shall prioritize review, either entering an order without a hearing or scheduling and holding an ex parte hearing in person, by telephone, by video, or by other electronic means on the day the petition is filed if possible. Otherwise, it must be heard no later than the following judicial day. The clerk shall ensure that the request for an ex parte temporary protection order is presented timely to a judicial officer, and signed orders will be returned promptly to the clerk for entry and to the petitioner as specified in this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(13) Courts shall not require a petitioner to file duplicative forms.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(14) The Indian child welfare act applies in the following manner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) In a proceeding under this chapter where the petitioner seeks to protect a minor and the petitioner is not the minor's parent as defined by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38.040'>13.38.040</a>, the petition must contain a statement alleging whether the minor is or may be an Indian child as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38.040'>13.38.040</a>. If the minor is an Indian child, chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38'>13.38</a> RCW and the federal Indian child welfare act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1901 et seq., shall apply. A party should allege in the petition if these laws have been satisfied in a prior proceeding and identify the proceeding.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Every order entered in any proceeding under this chapter where the petitioner is not a parent of the minor or minors protected by the order must contain a finding that the federal Indian child welfare act or chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38'>13.38</a> RCW does or does not apply, or if there is insufficient information to make a determination, the court must make a finding that a determination must be made before a full protection order may be entered. If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child, but the court does not have sufficient evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, 25 C.F.R. Sec. 23.107(b) applies. Where there is a finding that the federal Indian child welfare act or chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38'>13.38</a> RCW does apply, the order must also contain a finding that all notice, evidentiary requirements, and placement preferences under the federal Indian child welfare act and chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38'>13.38</a> RCW have been satisfied, or a finding that removal or placement of the child is necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1922 and RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38.140'>13.38.140</a>. Where there is a finding that the federal Indian child welfare act or chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.38'>13.38</a> RCW does not apply, the order must also contain a finding as to why there is no reason to know the child may be an Indian child.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105.310'>7.105.310</a> and 2022 c 268 s 17 and 2022 c 231 s 9 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) In issuing any type of protection order, other than an ex parte temporary antiharassment protection order as limited by subsection (2) of this section, and other than an extreme risk protection order, the court shall have broad discretion to grant such relief as the court deems proper, including an order that provides relief as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Restrain the respondent from committing any of the following acts against the petitioner and other persons protected by the order: Domestic violence; nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration; sexual abuse; stalking; acts of abandonment, abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation against a vulnerable adult; and unlawful harassment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Restrain the respondent from making any attempts to have contact, including nonphysical contact, with the petitioner or the petitioner's family or household members who are minors or other members of the petitioner's household, either directly, indirectly, or through third parties regardless of whether those third parties know of the order;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Exclude the respondent from the residence that the parties share;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Exclude the respondent from the residence, workplace, or school of the petitioner; or from the day care or school of a minor child;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Restrain the respondent from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance from a specified location including, but not limited to, a residence, school, day care, workplace, the protected party's person, and the protected party's vehicle.

However, parenting plans as specified in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09'>26.09</a> RCW must not be required under this chapter. The court may not delay or defer relief under this chapter on the grounds that the parties could seek a parenting plan or modification to a parenting plan in a different action. A protection order must not be denied on the grounds that the parties have an existing parenting plan in effect. A protection order may suspend the respondent's contact with the parties' children under an existing parenting plan, subject to further orders in a family law proceeding;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Order the respondent to participate in a state-certified domestic violence perpetrator treatment program approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.20A.735'>43.20A.735</a> or a state-certified sex offender treatment program approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.155.070'>18.155.070</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Order the respondent to obtain a mental health or chemical dependency evaluation. If the court determines that a mental health evaluation is necessary, the court shall clearly document the reason for this determination and provide a specific question or questions to be answered by the mental health professional. The court shall consider the ability of the respondent to pay for an evaluation. Minors are presumed to be unable to pay. The parent or legal guardian is responsible for costs unless the parent or legal guardian demonstrates inability to pay;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) In cases where the petitioner and the respondent are students who attend the same public or private elementary, middle, or high school, the court, when issuing a protection order and providing relief, shall consider, among the other facts of the case, the severity of the act, any continuing physical danger, emotional distress, or educational disruption to the petitioner, and the financial difficulty and educational disruption that would be caused by a transfer of the respondent to another school. The court may order that the respondent not attend the public or private elementary, middle, or high school attended by the petitioner. If a minor respondent is prohibited attendance at the minor's assigned public school, the school district must provide the student comparable educational services in another setting. In such a case, the district shall provide transportation at no cost to the respondent if the respondent's parent or legal guardian is unable to pay for transportation. The district shall put in place any needed supports to ensure successful transition to the new school environment. The court shall send notice of the restriction on attending the same school as the petitioner to the public or private school the respondent will attend and to the school the petitioner attends;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) Require the respondent to pay the administrative court costs and service fees, as established by the county or municipality incurring the expense, and to reimburse the petitioner for costs incurred in bringing the action, including reasonable attorneys' fees or limited license legal technician fees when such fees are incurred by a person licensed and practicing in accordance with state supreme court admission and practice rule 28, the limited practice rule for limited license legal technicians. Minors are presumed to be unable to pay. The parent or legal guardian is responsible for costs unless the parent or legal guardian demonstrates inability to pay;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) Restrain the respondent from harassing, following, monitoring, keeping under physical or electronic surveillance, cyber harassment as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.90.120'>9A.90.120</a>, and using telephonic, audiovisual, or other electronic means to monitor the actions, location, or communication of the petitioner or the petitioner's family or household members who are minors or other members of the petitioner's household. For the purposes of this subsection, "communication" includes both "wire communication" and "electronic communication" as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.73.260'>9.73.260</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) Other than for respondents who are minors, require the respondent to submit to electronic monitoring. The order must specify who shall provide the electronic monitoring services and the terms under which the monitoring must be performed. The order also may include a requirement that the respondent pay the costs of the monitoring. The court shall consider the ability of the respondent to pay for electronic monitoring;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) Consider the provisions of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.800'>9.41.800</a>, and order the respondent to surrender, and prohibit the respondent from accessing, having in his or her custody or control, possessing, purchasing, attempting to purchase or receive, or receiving, all firearms, dangerous weapons, and any concealed pistol license, as required in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.800'>9.41.800</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(n) Order possession and use of essential personal effects.

A petitioner may request this relief in the petition or by separate motion. A petitioner may request this relief by separate motion at any time within five years of the date the protection order is entered even if the order has since expired. A stand-alone motion for an order restricting abusive litigation may be brought by a party who meets the requirements of chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.51'>26.51</a> RCW regardless of whether the party has previously sought a protection order under this chapter, provided the motion is made within five years of the date the order that made a finding of domestic violence was entered.
