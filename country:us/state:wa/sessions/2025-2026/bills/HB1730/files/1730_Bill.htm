The tax imposed in this section is levied upon the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products immediately after receipt of the same into the storage tanks of a marine or bulk oil terminal from a tank car, pipeline, waterborne vessel, or barge at the rate of one cent per barrel of crude oil or petroleum product received.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) In addition to the tax imposed in subsection (1) of this section, an oil spill administration tax is imposed on the privilege of receiving: (a) Crude oil or petroleum products at a marine terminal within this state from a waterborne vessel or barge operating on the navigable waters of this state; or (b) crude oil or petroleum products at a bulk oil terminal within this state from a tank car or pipeline. The tax imposed in this section is levied upon the owner of the crude oil or petroleum products immediately after receipt of the same into the storage tanks of a marine or bulk oil terminal from a tank car, pipeline, waterborne vessel, or barge at the rate of four cents per barrel of crude oil or petroleum product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The taxes imposed by this chapter must be collected by the marine or bulk oil terminal operator from the taxpayer. If any person charged with collecting the taxes fails to bill the taxpayer for the taxes, or in the alternative has not notified the taxpayer in writing of the taxes imposed, or having collected the taxes, fails to pay them to the department in the manner prescribed by this chapter, whether such failure is the result of the person's own acts or the result of acts or conditions beyond the person's control, he or she, nevertheless, is personally liable to the state for the amount of the taxes. Payment of the taxes by the owner to a marine or bulk oil terminal operator relieves the owner from further liability for the taxes.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Taxes collected under this chapter must be held in trust until paid to the department. Any person collecting the taxes who appropriates or converts the taxes collected is guilty of a gross misdemeanor if the money required to be collected is not available for payment on the date payment is due. The taxes required by this chapter to be collected must be stated separately from other charges made by the marine or bulk oil terminal operator in any invoice or other statement of account provided to the taxpayer.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) If a taxpayer fails to pay the taxes imposed by this chapter to the person charged with collection of the taxes and the person charged with collection fails to pay the taxes to the department, the department may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the taxpayer for collection of the taxes.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The taxes are due from the marine or bulk oil terminal operator, along with reports and returns on forms prescribed by the department, within ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">25</span> days after the end of the month in which the taxable activity occurs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) The amount of taxes, until paid by the taxpayer to the marine or bulk oil terminal operator or to the department, constitutes a debt from the taxpayer to the marine or bulk oil terminal operator. Any person required to collect the taxes under this chapter who, with intent to violate the provisions of this chapter, fails or refuses to do so as required and any taxpayer who refuses to pay any taxes due under this chapter, is guilty of a misdemeanor as provided in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.20'>9A.20</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) Upon prior approval of the department, the taxpayer may pay the taxes imposed by this chapter directly to the department. The department must give its approval for direct payment under this section whenever it appears, in the department's judgment, that direct payment will enhance the administration of the taxes imposed under this chapter. The department must provide by rule for the issuance of a direct payment certificate to any taxpayer qualifying for direct payment of the taxes. Good faith acceptance of a direct payment certificate by a terminal operator relieves the marine or bulk oil terminal operator from any liability for the collection or payment of the taxes imposed under this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9)(a) ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">All</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, all</span> receipts from the tax imposed in subsection (1) of this section must be deposited into the state oil spill response account.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Beginning in fiscal year 2019 and each fiscal year thereafter, the first ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">two hundred thousand dollars</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">$200,000</span> of receipts from the tax imposed in subsection (2) of this section must be deposited into the military department active state service account created in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=38.40.220'>38.40.220</a>, and the remainder of the receipts from the tax imposed in subsection (2) of this section must be deposited into the oil spill prevention account <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or the aeronautics account, as provided in this subsection (9)</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) The receipts from the tax imposed in subsection (1) of this section on aircraft fuel as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.42.010'>82.42.010</a>, must be deposited into the aeronautics account created in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.42.090'>82.42.090</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) Within ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">forty-five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">45</span> days after the end of each calendar quarter, the office of financial management must determine the balance of the oil spill response account as of the last day of that calendar quarter.
