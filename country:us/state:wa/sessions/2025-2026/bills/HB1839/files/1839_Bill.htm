According to a 2024 report published by the Washington roundtable, the state's anticipated job growth is 12.8 percent, well above the national average of 2.8 percent, creating opportunity for skilled workers. Three quarters of jobs will require postsecondary credentials. However, Washington faces a projected shortfall of nearly 600,000 credentialed workers over the decade, including 301,000 with bachelor's and advanced degrees, 67,000 with associate degrees, and 228,000 with certifications, apprenticeships, and other training credentials.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Therefore, the legislature finds it necessary to grow investments in workforce education and finds that additional resources would be best guided towards expanding the Washington college grant program to families earning 70 percent of the median family income, increasing the number of teacher training and STEM teacher training programs, growing the number of in-state student seats in our institutions of higher education, and funding work-study salaries for students doing STEM research.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.299'>82.04.299</a> and 2022 c 170 s 1 and 2022 c 56 s 4 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) Beginning with business activities occurring on or after April 1, 2020, in addition to the taxes imposed under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.290'>82.04.290</a>(2), a workforce education investment surcharge is imposed on select advanced computing businesses.
