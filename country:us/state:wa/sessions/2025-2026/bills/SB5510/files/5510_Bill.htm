The county legislative authority may provide for this system of rates and charges as an alternative to, but not in addition to, a special assessment provided by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=89.08.400'>89.08.400</a>. In fixing rates and charges, the county legislative authority may in its discretion consider the information proposed to the county legislative authority by a conservation district consistent with this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A conservation district, in proposing a system of rates and charges, may consider:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Services furnished, to be furnished, or available to the landowner;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Benefits received, to be received, or available to the property;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The character and use of land;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The public benefit nonprofit corporation status, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=24.03A.245'>24.03A.245</a>, of the land user;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The income level of persons served or provided benefits under this chapter, including senior citizens and disabled persons; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Any other matters that present a reasonable difference as a ground for distinction, including the natural resource needs within the district and the capacity of the district to provide either services or improvements, or both.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3)(a) The system of rates and charges may include an annual per acre amount, an annual per parcel amount, or an annual per parcel amount plus an annual per acre amount. If included in the system of rates and charges, the maximum annual per acre rate or charge shall not exceed ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ten</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10</span> cents per acre.

The calculation of the weighted average per acre shall be a ratio calculated as follows: (i) The numerator shall be the total amount of money estimated to be derived from the per acre special rates and charges on the nonforestlands in the conservation district; and (ii) the denominator shall be the total number of nonforestland acres in the conservation district that are served by the activities of the conservation district and that are subject to the rates or charges of the conservation district.

The rates and charges from the roll shall be spread by the county assessor as a separate item on the tax rolls and shall be collected and accounted for with property taxes by the county treasurer. The amount of the rates and charges shall constitute a lien against the land that shall be subject to the same conditions as a tax lien, and collected by the treasurer in the same manner as delinquent real property taxes, and subject to the same interest and penalty as for delinquent property taxes. The county treasurer shall deduct an amount from the collected rates and charges, as established by the county legislative authority, to cover the costs incurred by the county assessor and county treasurer in spreading and collecting the rates and charges, but not to exceed the actual costs of such work <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or one percent of the amount collected, whichever is lower</span>.
