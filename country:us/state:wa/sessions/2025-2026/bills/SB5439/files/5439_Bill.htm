It also finds that investments in coal-fired resources contribute to climate change, damage the environment, air, water, and soil, and disproportionately harm the health of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its energy sector by requiring that each electric utility eliminate coal-fired resources from its allocation of electricity by December 31, 2025. To support the elimination of coal-fired electricity generation and protect ratepayers, the legislature has required the utilities and transportation commission to accelerate depreciation schedules for coal-fired resources owned by investor-owned utilities by no later than the end of 2025.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that the state investment board maintains investments in coal assets at a time when governments, public pension funds, and institutional investors, including CalPERS, CalSTRS, the New York state common retirement fund, the New York city employees' retirement system, and the Oregon public employees retirement fund have committed to divesting from coal. The legislature further finds that the state investment board has developed a climate blueprint to guide investment decisions that impact and are impacted by climate change while fulfilling its mission of maximizing returns at a prudent level of risk for the benefit of beneficiaries.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to protect public health and the environment and align with Washington's clean energy goals by divesting all funds under management by the state investment board from thermal coal.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21A'>43.21A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The definition of "thermal coal company" under section 3 of this act is based on definitions developed by the Urgewald organization as they existed on January 1, 2025.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Beginning January 1, 2030, the department must annually review the definition of "thermal coal company" under section 3 of this act as compared to the definition used by the Urgewald organization at the time of the review and report meaningful changes to the relevant environmental committees of the legislature, and the legislature shall consider updating the definition of "thermal coal company."</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.33A'>43.33A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Clean energy" means both nonemitting electric generation and electricity from renewable resources as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.020'>19.405.020</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Global coal exit list" means the list of coal industry participants identified by the Urgewald organization.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Subject investment funds" means all funds under management by the state investment board.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Thermal coal company" means a company, or parent or subsidiary of a company:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) From the mining, power, and services sector that derives at least 10 percent of its annual revenue from activities related to thermal coal;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) From the utility sector that generates 10 percent or more of its power from coal based on actual generation or installed capacity;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Whose annual thermal coal production is equal to or greater than 10,000,000 tons of coal;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Whose installed coal-fired capacity generation is equal to or greater than five gigawatts;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Planning to develop new coal-fired power capacity of at least 100 megawatts prorated;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Engaged in coal exploration activities or planning to expand their coal mines;
