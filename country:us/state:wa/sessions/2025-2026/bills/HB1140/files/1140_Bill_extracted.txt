(1) The state Constitution makes clear that it is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex. The legislature finds the state is failing to meet that paramount duty by providing an education system that, as it exists in statute, discriminates based on these protected classes by forcing children into schools based on their zip code. This creates a system where children and their families often have no other choice but a failing local public school. The state does not provide for the education of children outside of the public school system which means the quality of their education is set by what neighborhood they live in. This is a blatant injustice and a profound violation of civil rights.(2) The legislature also recognizes the power entrusted to parents to do what is best for their children. Parents can choose to place their student in a common school, charter public school, private school, micro school, or provide home-based instruction. However, not all parents have access to every option. Public charter schools are limited in number and space, while private school options require an extra financial investment from families. Home school requires both, extra financial and time investments, from parents. The legislature knows that wealthy families can pay to send their students to a private school but the families for many kids in rural and poor communities often do not have this ability. The legislature intends to allow all students regardless of protected or socioeconomic status to have the same opportunity to succeed.(3) While the legislature has spent years increasing funding to the public school system, the legislature acknowledges many students have been left behind. National test scores for Washington students have been falling over the last decade and, after extensive school closures, state test scores are down to the lowest levels since administration of the smarter balanced assessment began. For the 2023-24 school year, over 60 percent of Washington's students did not meet grade level standards in math and half did not meet grade level standards in English. School closures also disproportionately impacted students with the most need, specifically those from underrepresented communities. Students with disabilities who were eligible for special education services were delayed in getting their needed supports for too long. It is clear Washington state's public school system is failing families by not preparing students for their future.(4) Academic outcomes are not the only reason public schools in Washington are failing students and families. Our schools are unsafe, and it is unacceptable. With a shift in focus toward divisive instruction, rising childhood mental and behavioral health problems, ineffective discipline policies, rampant bullying, drug abuse, and troubling allegations of sexual misconduct, parents, teachers, and communities are abandoning the system. Recent data paints a disturbing picture: 18 percent of students statewide report feeling unsafe at school, and a staggering 70 percent of teachers feel afraid to go to work. Even more alarming, 79 percent of teachers have been subjected to physical violence, and 67 percent say that violence has driven them to consider leaving the profession. Yet, school districts and the state continue failing to fix these issues, allowing this crisis to fester. Since the 2018-19 school year, there has been a 10 percent increase in private school students and an over 32 percent increase in students receiving home-based instruction. This means less funding for public schools. Pair that with communities failing to pass levies and bonds and you have an even tougher financial dilemma for public schools. If Washington is serious about fixing its schools, we must allow funding to follow students, shattering the public school monopoly and forcing the system to address its deep-rooted problems. By introducing more educational competition, the legislature has the opportunity to rebuild trust, confront these urgent challenges, and provide every child with a safe and world-class education, worthwhile of the investment from Washington taxpayers.(5) The legislature understands many interests served by the current system of public education in our state will oppose families having the freedom to find an adequate education for their children. Longstanding jurisprudence has said that education is a foundational purpose of government, therefore education savings accounts are in no way a gift of public funds. It is in the best interest of Washington state to educate its citizenry and empower parents to do what is best for their child, regardless of their zip code.(6) The legislature also acknowledges that some will object to some of the choices families may make. Namely that some families will choose for a myriad of reasons to send their student to a religious private school. However, the United States supreme court has made it clear through two recent cases, Carson v. Makin and Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, that if the government creates a program, it cannot then discriminate against religious institutions' participation. This is not a new concept for Washington state. This state has a history of providing education funding support in private religious institutions, specifically for postsecondary education programs.(7) The legislature anticipates that some advocates for public schools and public school teachers will argue this scholarship will defund or damage public schools. However, in no state where education savings accounts have been implemented has this been the case. To the contrary, research shows that test results and outcomes for students in public schools have universally improved in states that have implemented education savings accounts. The competition introduced into these state systems have actually alleviated the harms that a public school monopoly creates.(8) The legislature finds that the increased funding and current leadership of the public school system has not led to any positive measurable outcomes for students. The current approach of increasing funding to teachers and administration in hopes of it trickling down to better educational outcomes for students has failed. It is time to empower parents to do what is best for their children by joining the majority of states in expanding school choice. Measures like this enjoy overwhelming, bipartisan support wherever they are implemented. Washington now has the opportunity to not just follow suit, but to take the lead in improving their model of success. This is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is time for Washington to follow the majority of other states in confronting it head on.(9) Therefore, the legislature intends to allow the money invested in students to follow the student by establishing the empowerED scholarship program. The program would fund education savings accounts for students with priority given to those students who are being failed by the current model, specifically students eligible for special education services, low-income students, and students in failing schools. Parents who apply for the scholarship on behalf of their students are legally required to only use the funds for education-related expenses. The legislature intends to make the funds accessible with the use of a debit card managed by the state with oversight capability so that the system can be audited. The accounts will be funded on a progressive scale, with the lowest income students, qualifying for a greater award. Students eligible for special education services will qualify for additional support. The fund will receive revenue from the legislature, as well as a B&O tax credit, so businesses can provide direct support to students. This measure will empower parents to do what is best for their student regardless of income level or zip code, while also meeting the state's moral and constitutional obligation to put all students first, not just the wealthy ones.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.

ï»¿H-0262.1HOUSE BILL 1140State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Couture, Walsh, Corry, Ley, Jacobsen, and BarnardPrefiled 12/30/24.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Education.AN ACT Relating to creating school choice with empowerED scholarships using educational savings accounts; amending RCW 28A.225.350; reenacting and amending RCW 43.79A.040 and 43.79A.040; adding a new section to chapter 28B.77 RCW; adding a new chapter to Title 28A RCW; adding a new chapter to Title 82 RCW; creating new sections; providing an effective date; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The state Constitution makes clear that it is the paramount duty of the state to make ample provision for the education of all children residing within its borders, without distinction or preference on account of race, color, caste, or sex. The legislature finds the state is failing to meet that paramount duty by providing an education system that, as it exists in statute, discriminates based on these protected classes by forcing children into schools based on their zip code. This creates a system where children and their families often have no other choice but a failing local public school. The state does not provide for the education of children outside of the public school system which means the quality of their education is set by what neighborhood they live in. This is a blatant injustice and a profound violation of civil rights.(2) The legislature also recognizes the power entrusted to parents to do what is best for their children. Parents can choose to place their student in a common school, charter public school, private school, micro school, or provide home-based instruction. However, not all parents have access to every option. Public charter schools are limited in number and space, while private school options require an extra financial investment from families. Home school requires both, extra financial and time investments, from parents. The legislature knows that wealthy families can pay to send their students to a private school but the families for many kids in rural and poor communities often do not have this ability. The legislature intends to allow all students regardless of protected or socioeconomic status to have the same opportunity to succeed.(3) While the legislature has spent years increasing funding to the public school system, the legislature acknowledges many students have been left behind. National test scores for Washington students have been falling over the last decade and, after extensive school closures, state test scores are down to the lowest levels since administration of the smarter balanced assessment began. For the 2023-24 school year, over 60 percent of Washington's students did not meet grade level standards in math and half did not meet grade level standards in English. School closures also disproportionately impacted students with the most need, specifically those from underrepresented communities. Students with disabilities who were eligible for special education services were delayed in getting their needed supports for too long. It is clear Washington state's public school system is failing families by not preparing students for their future.(4) Academic outcomes are not the only reason public schools in Washington are failing students and families. Our schools are unsafe, and it is unacceptable. With a shift in focus toward divisive instruction, rising childhood mental and behavioral health problems, ineffective discipline policies, rampant bullying, drug abuse, and troubling allegations of sexual misconduct, parents, teachers, and communities are abandoning the system. Recent data paints a disturbing picture: 18 percent of students statewide report feeling unsafe at school, and a staggering 70 percent of teachers feel afraid to go to work. Even more alarming, 79 percent of teachers have been subjected to physical violence, and 67 percent say that violence has driven them to consider leaving the profession. Yet, school districts and the state continue failing to fix these issues, allowing this crisis to fester. Since the 2018-19 school year, there has been a 10 percent increase in private school students and an over 32 percent increase in students receiving home-based instruction. This means less funding for public schools. Pair that with communities failing to pass levies and bonds and you have an even tougher financial dilemma for public schools. If Washington is serious about fixing its schools, we must allow funding to follow students, shattering the public school monopoly and forcing the system to address its deep-rooted problems. By introducing more educational competition, the legislature has the opportunity to rebuild trust, confront these urgent challenges, and provide every child with a safe and world-class education, worthwhile of the investment from Washington taxpayers.(5) The legislature understands many interests served by the current system of public education in our state will oppose families having the freedom to find an adequate education for their children. Longstanding jurisprudence has said that education is a foundational purpose of government, therefore education savings accounts are in no way a gift of public funds. It is in the best interest of Washington state to educate its citizenry and empower parents to do what is best for their child, regardless of their zip code.(6) The legislature also acknowledges that some will object to some of the choices families may make. Namely that some families will choose for a myriad of reasons to send their student to a religious private school. However, the United States supreme court has made it clear through two recent cases, Carson v. Makin and Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, that if the government creates a program, it cannot then discriminate against religious institutions' participation. This is not a new concept for Washington state. This state has a history of providing education funding support in private religious institutions, specifically for postsecondary education programs.(7) The legislature anticipates that some advocates for public schools and public school teachers will argue this scholarship will defund or damage public schools. However, in no state where education savings accounts have been implemented has this been the case. To the contrary, research shows that test results and outcomes for students in public schools have universally improved in states that have implemented education savings accounts. The competition introduced into these state systems have actually alleviated the harms that a public school monopoly creates.(8) The legislature finds that the increased funding and current leadership of the public school system has not led to any positive measurable outcomes for students. The current approach of increasing funding to teachers and administration in hopes of it trickling down to better educational outcomes for students has failed. It is time to empower parents to do what is best for their children by joining the majority of states in expanding school choice. Measures like this enjoy overwhelming, bipartisan support wherever they are implemented. Washington now has the opportunity to not just follow suit, but to take the lead in improving their model of success. This is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is time for Washington to follow the majority of other states in confronting it head on.(9) Therefore, the legislature intends to allow the money invested in students to follow the student by establishing the empowerED scholarship program. The program would fund education savings accounts for students with priority given to those students who are being failed by the current model, specifically students eligible for special education services, low-income students, and students in failing schools. Parents who apply for the scholarship on behalf of their students are legally required to only use the funds for education-related expenses. The legislature intends to make the funds accessible with the use of a debit card managed by the state with oversight capability so that the system can be audited. The accounts will be funded on a progressive scale, with the lowest income students, qualifying for a greater award. Students eligible for special education services will qualify for additional support. The fund will receive revenue from the legislature, as well as a B&O tax credit, so businesses can provide direct support to students. This measure will empower parents to do what is best for their student regardless of income level or zip code, while also meeting the state's moral and constitutional obligation to put all students first, not just the wealthy ones.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
