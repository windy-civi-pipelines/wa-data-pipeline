ï»¿S-1807.1SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5694State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Labor & Commerce (originally sponsored by Senator King)READ FIRST TIME 02/21/25.AN ACT Relating to a statewide boiler operator certification; amending RCW 70.79.030, 70.79.040, 70.79.090, and 70.79.110; adding new sections to chapter 70.79 RCW; creating a new section; repealing RCW 70.79.050; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that there are only three jurisdictions that regulate the safe operation of boilers by certified boiler operators. The national board of boiler and pressure vessel inspectors has advised that trained boiler operators are essential to avoiding potential risks to personnel, the public, and property.The national board stated that "The primary concern in the operation of boilers, regardless of pressure or type, is safety. Too often, automatic features lead owners and the general public to believe that the equipment will function without worker oversight, maintenance, operation, and repair. A boiler can fail regardless of its level of automation and a boiler failure can lead to catastrophic results. Even the automatic controls must be properly maintained and tested at specific intervals to keep them functioning properly."The legislature further finds that ensuring boiler safety is critical and the best way to achieve this goal is through the unification of the existing certification and training expectations for the entire state to ensure portability of the certification and that the workers in this field possess the necessary skills, training, and abilities for the safe operation, maintenance, and repair of boilers. This act is intended not to create a drastically new system, but to utilize the currently recognized certification programs for certification of all workers. A worker who retains certification from any jurisdiction having the authority, and approved by the board, to administer an approved boiler operator certification program is intended to be considered appropriately certified and compliant with this act. The role of the department of labor and industries is intended to be to enforce that these certification requirements are complied with.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 70.79 RCW to read as follows:The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Board" means the board of boiler rules established pursuant to RCW 70.79.010.(2) "Department" means the department of labor and industries.Sec. 3. RCW 70.79.030 and 1999 c 183 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:The board shall formulate definitions and rules for the safe and proper construction, installation, repair, use, and operation of boilers ((and for)), the safe and proper construction, installation, and repair of unfired pressure vessels in this state, and for certification of boiler operators. The definitions and rules so formulated shall be based upon, and, at all times, follow the nationally or internationally accepted engineering standards, formulae, and practices established and pertaining to boiler and unfired pressure vessel construction and safety, and the board may by resolution adopt existing published codifications thereof, and when so adopted the same shall be deemed incorporated into, and to constitute a part or the whole of the definitions and rules of the board. Amendments and interpretations to the code shall be enforceable immediately upon being adopted, to the end that the definitions and rules shall at all times follow nationally or internationally accepted engineering standards. However, all rules adopted by the board shall be adopted in compliance with the ((Administrative Procedure Act))administrative procedure act, chapter 34.05 RCW, as now or hereafter amended.Sec. 4. RCW 70.79.040 and 1951 c 32 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The board shall promulgate rules and regulations for the safe and proper installation, repair, use, and operation of boilers, and for the safe and proper installation and repair of unfired pressure vessels which were in use or installed ready for use in this state prior to the date upon which the first rules and regulations under this chapter pertaining to existing installations became effective, or during the ((twelve months))12-month period immediately thereafter.(2) The board shall adopt rules necessary to implement a certification program for boiler operators who operate and maintain boilers. Initial rules adopted under this subsection must take effect on January 1, 2028.Sec. 5. RCW 70.79.090 and 2021 c 65 s 67 are each amended to read as follows:The following boilers and unfired pressure vessels shall be exempt from the requirements of RCW 70.79.220 ((and)), 70.79.240 through 70.79.330, and sections 7 through 12 of this act:(1) Boilers or unfired pressure vessels located on farms and used solely for agricultural purposes;(2) Unfired pressure vessels that are part of fertilizer applicator rigs designed and used exclusively for fertilization in the conduct of agricultural operations;(3) Steam boilers used exclusively for heating purposes carrying a pressure of not more than ((fifteen))15 pounds per square inch gauge and which are located in private residences or in apartment houses of less than six families;(4) Hot water heating boilers carrying a pressure of not more than ((thirty))30 pounds per square inch and which are located in private residences or in apartment houses of less than six families;(5) Approved pressure vessels (hot water heaters, hot water storage tanks, hot water supply boilers, and hot water heating boilers listed by a nationally recognized testing agency), with approved safety devices including a pressure relief valve, with a nominal water containing capacity of ((one hundred twenty))120 gallons or less having a heat input of ((two hundred thousand b.t.u.'s per hour))200,000 Btu/h or less, at pressure of ((one hundred sixty))160 pounds per square inch or less, and at temperatures of ((two hundred ten))210 degrees Fahrenheit or less: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That such pressure vessels are not installed in schools, child care centers, public and private hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, churches, public buildings owned or leased and maintained by the state or any political subdivision thereof, and assembly halls;(6) Unfired pressure vessels containing only water under pressure for domestic supply purposes, including those containing air, the compression of which serves only as a cushion or airlift pumping systems, when located in private residences or in apartment houses of less than six families, or in public water systems as defined in RCW 70A.120.020;(7) Unfired pressure vessels containing liquefied petroleum gases.Sec. 6. RCW 70.79.110 and 1951 c 32 s 11 are each amended to read as follows:The chief inspector, if authorized by the director of the department ((of labor and industries)) is hereby charged, directed and empowered:(1) To cause the prosecution of all violators of the provisions of this chapter;(2) To issue, or to suspend, or revoke for cause, inspection certificates as provided for in RCW 70.79.290;(3) To take action necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the state governing the use of boilers and unfired pressure vessels and of the rules and regulations of the board;(4) To keep a complete record of the type, dimensions, maximum allowable working pressure, age, condition, location, and date of the last recorded internal inspection of all boilers and unfired pressure vessels to which this chapter applies;(5) To publish and distribute, among manufacturers and others requesting them, copies of the rules and regulations adopted by the board.(6) To issue, suspend, or revoke for cause boiler operator certifications issued under this chapter.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 7.

The examination must be constructed to determine:(a) Whether the applicant possesses varied knowledge of the technical information and practical procedures that are identified with the level boiler operation; and(b) Whether the applicant is familiar with the applicable national and international codes, this chapter, and the administrative rules of the department pertaining to boiler operation and general maintenance.(2) The department may enter into a contract with a nationally recognized testing agency to develop, administer, and score any examinations required by this section.
