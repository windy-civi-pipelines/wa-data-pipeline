It remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans each year, including 8,300 Washingtonians. Of cancer deaths in Washington, 27 percent are attributable to smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The growing market for flavored tobacco and nicotine products is undermining the nation's progress in reducing overall youth tobacco use. Flavored tobacco and nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, have been shown to be starter products for youth who begin using tobacco, establishing tobacco habits that can lead to long-term addiction. Of youth who have ever used a tobacco product, eight out of 10 initiated with a flavored product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The United States surgeon general declared youth vapor product use an "epidemic" in 2018. More than 1,600,000 middle and high school students across the United States currently use vapor products, including almost eight percent of 10th graders and 14 percent of 12th graders in Washington. Of high school students who vape, 42 percent are addicted enough to use frequently or daily.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Youth vape because they come in appealing, kid-friendly flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, and pink lemonade. About 88 percent of youth who vape use a flavored product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The tobacco industry continues to redesign products to become even more appealing to youth, with some of the newest products featuring light-up video games like pac-man and tetris.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Vaping is not harmless. Youth vapor product use is associated with an increased risk for cigarette smoking, and according to the surgeon general, nicotine can harm the parts of the adolescent brain responsible for attention, learning, mood, and impulse control, and can prime the brain for addiction to other drugs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Like vapor products, cigars are also sold in hundreds of flavors, including tropical twist, chocolate brownie, and cherry dynamite, which mask the harsh taste of tobacco. Black and Hispanic youth smoke cigars at higher rates than white youth. Regular cigar use can cause cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lung, and it kills approximately 9,000 Americans each year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Each year, more than 9,100 kids in Washington try their first cigarette, with half initiating with menthol cigarettes. Menthol appeals to youth who are initiating tobacco use because it cools and numbs the throat and reduces irritation. The food and drug administration has concluded that menthol cigarettes lead to increased smoking initiation among youth and young adults, greater addiction, and decreased success in quitting smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The centers for disease control estimates that prohibiting menthol cigarettes in Washington state would lead to 7,400 adults to quit smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) The tobacco industry has targeted African American communities for decades with marketing for menthol cigarettes through sponsorship of community and music events, targeted magazine advertising, and retail promotions. The result today is that 85 percent of Black smokers and 50 percent of Hispanic smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, compared to 29 percent of white smokers. Each year approximately 45,000 African Americans die from a smoking-caused illness. Ending the sale of flavored tobacco and nicotine products will improve the health and save lives of groups who historically have been targeted by the tobacco industry and disproportionally burdened by tobacco-related disease.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) The number of youth using nicotine pouches has more than doubled since 2021, with nearly half a million youth reporting current nicotine pouch use in 2024.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) Hookah smoking is linked to many of the same adverse health effects as cigarette smoking, such as heart disease and lung, bladder, and oral cancers. Hookah is available in more than 1,800 varieties, including kid-friendly flavors like bubble gum, cola, and watermelon, and 84 percent of youth hookah users use flavored hookah.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature therefore intends to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco and nicotine products and entertainment vapor products to reduce youth usage and protect the next generation from a lifetime of addiction and premature death.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Entertainment vapor product" means any vapor product that has interactive gaming or entertainment features including, but not limited to, allowing a user to play music or audio, display photos or video, play virtual games, or display other animations on the device.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Flavored tobacco or nicotine product" means any tobacco or nicotine product that imparts:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A taste or smell, other than the taste or smell of tobacco, distinguishable by an ordinary consumer either before or during the consumption of such tobacco product including, but not limited to, the taste or smell of fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey, candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, mint, wintergreen, menthol, herb, or spice; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A cooling or numbing sensation distinguishable by an ordinary consumer either before or during the consumption of such tobacco product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Nicotine" means any form of the chemical nicotine, including any salt or complex, regardless of whether the chemical is naturally or synthetically derived, and includes nicotinic alkaloids and nicotine analogs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Retailer" means any person engaged in the business of selling tobacco or nicotine products or vapor products to ultimate consumers.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5)(a) "Tobacco or nicotine product" means any:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Product containing, made of, or derived from tobacco or nicotine that is intended for human consumption or is likely to be consumed, whether inhaled, absorbed, or ingested by any other means, including, but not limited to, a cigarette, a cigar, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, snuff, or snus;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Vapor product and any substance that may be aerosolized or vaporized by such product, whether or not the substance contains nicotine; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Component, part, or accessory of a product described in this subsection (5), regardless of whether such component, part, or accessory contains tobacco or nicotine including, but not limited to, filters, rolling papers, blunt or hemp wraps, hookahs, flavor enhancers, mouthpieces, or pipes.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) "Tobacco or nicotine product" does not mean:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Drugs, devices, or combination products authorized for sale by the United States food and drug administration, as those terms are defined in the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act (21 U.S.C.
