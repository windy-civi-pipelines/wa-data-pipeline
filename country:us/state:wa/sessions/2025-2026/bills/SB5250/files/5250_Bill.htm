Therefore, the legislature intends to strengthen Washington's antisquatting law by expanding it to cover former tenants who are no longer occupying premises pursuant to a valid rental agreement, and by authorizing law enforcement to remove squatters without delay.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span
