The legislature finds that advanced nuclear reactors hold great promise for delivering significant amounts of nonemitting energy to the grid with enhanced safety and increased efficiency. Nuclear energy is a clean, firm complement to renewable resources, has low land-use requirements, and provides high-paying jobs and regional economic benefits. Therefore, the legislature finds value in encouraging electric utilities to invest now in new advanced nuclear reactor projects as these utilities work to comply with clean energy transformation act requirements by 2045.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.040'>19.405.040</a> and 2019 c 288 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It is the policy of the state that all retail sales of electricity to Washington retail electric customers be greenhouse gas neutral by January 1, 2030.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) For the four-year compliance period beginning January 1, 2030, and for each multiyear compliance period thereafter through December 31, 2044, an electric utility must demonstrate its compliance with this standard using a combination of nonemitting electric generation and electricity from renewable resources, or alternative compliance options, as provided in this section.
