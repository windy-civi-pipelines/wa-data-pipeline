The legislature has taken steps in recent years to boost the state's housing supply through grants and incentive programs, permitting reform, and increasing density in certain land use zones. However, the state has seen the average home price in Washington rise 55 percent between 2018 to 2021. During roughly the same time period, the change in share of homes purchased by medium, large, and mega investors increased by 46 percent. These types of investors currently own just over seven percent of the housing supply in Washington, locking out families from real estate ownership opportunities and the ability to develop intergenerational wealth. Therefore, the legislature intends to prohibit large investment and business entities from purchasing more of the state's existing stock of homes so that the affordable housing supply is available for purchase by residents and families.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1)(a) A business entity that has an interest in more than 50 single-family residential properties may not purchase, acquire, or otherwise obtain an interest in another single-family residential property.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(b) An investment entity may not purchase, acquire, or otherwise obtain an interest in a single-family residential property.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) For the purposes of this section:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) "Business entity" means any association, company, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or other legal entity, and that entity's successors, assignees, or affiliates.
