A central mission of Washington's student health centers serving these institutions is to minimize the negative impact of health concerns on students' studies and to facilitate retention and graduation.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Students seeking pregnancy termination face substantial travel, financial, and logistical barriers. Students must travel as far as 78 miles, or over four hours on public transit, round trip to the nearest abortion-providing facility, and the average wait time for an appointment is 10 days. The supreme court <span style="font-style:italic;">Dobbs v. Jackson</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> women's health organization</span> decision has increased the burden on abortion-providing facilities in the state, meaning longer wait times for students needing to access care. A 2024 report from senator Maria Cantwell's office states that clinics in Oregon have already seen a 50 percent increase in patients from Washington state traveling for abortion care, and the average wait times in Washington for abortion appointments in a Seattle area clinic have already increased by one week due to the influx of patients traveling from out of state. These financial and time burdens negatively impact academic performance, mental health, and physical health.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Many of Washington's public institutions of higher education have student health centers, but only two campuses with student health centers are known to be in the process of implementing abortion services. Medication abortion is extremely safe, efficacious, and cost-effective. Research shows that the provision of medication abortion in student health centers is safe, effective, and feasible.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Because medication abortion is recognized as a safe and effective treatment for pregnancy termination and a health service every pregnant person in the state has the legal right to choose, it is the intent of the legislature that public institutions of higher education make medication abortion as accessible and cost-effective for students as possible.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Council" means the Washington student achievement council as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.77.010'>28B.77.010</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Medication abortion" has the same meaning as "abortionÂ medications" in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.41.050'>69.41.050</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Public institution of higher education" or "public institutions of higher education" means institutions of higher education as defined in RCWÂ  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Student health center" means a clinic or health center providing physical health care services to students operated by public institutions of higher education.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) By the start of the 2026-27 academic year, each student health center must offer access to medication abortion, either through a public program that connects patients in Washington to reproductive health services or through other delivery methods.
