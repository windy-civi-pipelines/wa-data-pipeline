Insurance executives, whose bonuses increase when payouts to patients decrease, dominate the system, leaving patients and providers struggling to navigate a system that prioritizes profits over care.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Therefore, the legislature seeks to reform this broken system by putting patients at the center, ensuring the system works for all stakeholders, especially those in need. The goal of this act is to bring equity, transparency, and fairness to the dental insurance market. By aligning dental insurance protections with those already established for medical insurance, it ensures patients have the same rights and protections. The focus is on making dental benefits work for people, not corporations. A key element of the reform is protecting patient choice. Patients should be able to choose a trusted dentist and receive the full benefits they pay for, regardless of network restrictions. Therefore, the legislature intends to eliminate corporate restrictions that limit care and undermine the patient-provider relationship.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Additionally, the legislature intends to mandate that at least 85 percent of premium dollars be spent directly on care, ensuring that patients get value for what they pay. The legislature further intends for patients to request an independent review of denied claims, empowering them to receive necessary care, as well as tackling additional actions by insurance companies taking advantage of patients and providers. This act addresses inequities in the dental benefits system, especially for vulnerable populations, by creating a fairer, more transparent market that improves access to care and reduces out-of-pocket costs for all Washington residents.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.44'>48.44</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) A limited health care service contractor that offers coverage for dental care services shall permit a treating dentist, in consultation with the covered person, to make all decisions on dental services provided to the covered person, rather than making such decisions through contracts or agreements between the dentist and the limited health care service contractor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Consistent with (a) of this subsection, the limited health care service contractor may not:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Deny coverage for services provided by the dentist based on an independent diagnosis made by the limited health care service contractor or an employee or agent of the limited health care service contractor; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Deny coverage for procedures on the basis that the procedures were performed on the same day.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The decisions made by the dentist, in consultation with the covered person, under (a) of this subsection must be based on accepted dental practices.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A limited health care service contractor that offers coverage for dental care services may not modify the reimbursement rates paid to a contracting dentist during the term of the contract, unless the contracting dentist agrees to the modification in writing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) For purposes of this section, "limited health care service contractor" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.44.035'>48.44.035</a>.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.44.035'>48.44.035</a> and 1997 c 212 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) For purposes of this section ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">only</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and section 2 of this act</span>, "limited health care service" means dental care services, vision care services, mental health services, chemical dependency services, pharmaceutical services, podiatric care services, and such other services as may be determined by the commissioner to be limited health services, but does not include hospital, medical, surgical, emergency, or out-of-area services except as those services are provided incidentally to the limited health services set forth in this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) For purposes of this section ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">only</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">and section 2 of this act</span>, a "limited health care service contractor" means a health care service contractor that offers one and only one limited health care service.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, every limited health care service contractor must have and maintain a minimum net worth of three hundred thousand dollars.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) A limited health care service contractor registered before July 27, 1997, that, on July 27, 1997, has a minimum net worth equal to or greater than that required by subsection (3) of this section must continue to have and maintain the minimum net worth required by subsection (3) of this section.
