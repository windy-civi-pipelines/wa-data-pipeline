Many modern consumer products contain digital components, such as microprocessors and microchips, which can create barriers to repairs. In some United States' households, everything from the coffee maker, to the washing machine, vacuum, thermostat, or doorbell may have a digital component as technology has evolved and smart products have increased in popularity;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The need for more accessible and affordable repair options is felt more acutely among specific sectors of the population, notably Washington residents in rural areas and people who earn low incomes. Original manufacturer shops or authorized repair providers are often located in urban areas requiring consumers to travel long distances for repair or be without products for periods of time;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Small, independent businesses play a vital role in Washington's economy. Providing access to information, parts, and tools is essential in contributing to a competitive repair market, allowing small repair shop employees to repair products more safely;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Certain electronic products are comprised of precious metals that are finite, and unnecessary early disposal can be avoided with greater accessibility to proper and affordable repair; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Other states such as Minnesota, New York, California, and Colorado have enacted right to repair legislation, recognizing the need to increase access to the documentation, tools, and parts necessary to facilitate multiple repair options for all kinds of consumer products with digital electronics.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to broaden access to the information and tools necessary to repair digital electronic products, including computers, cell phones, appliances, and other nonexempted products in a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable manner, thereby increasing access to appropriate and affordable digital electronic products, supporting small businesses and jobs, and making it easier for all residents of Washington state to connect digitally.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Authorized repair provider" means an individual or business that is unaffiliated with an original manufacturer and that has an arrangement with the original manufacturer to use the original manufacturer's trade name, service mark, or other proprietary identifier for the purpose of offering the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic products under the name of the original manufacturer, or that has an arrangement with the original manufacturer under which the individual or business offers the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic products on behalf of the original manufacturer.
