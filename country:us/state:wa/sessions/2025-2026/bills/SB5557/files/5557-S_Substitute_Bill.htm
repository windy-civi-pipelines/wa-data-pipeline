The people of Washington have repeatedly affirmed this right, and it is the legislature's responsibility to ensure that our residents have access to care that puts patients first regardless of federal actions. Pregnant patients have been able to rely on federal protections when they seek emergency medical care, but due to renewed uncertainty at the federal level, the legislature must provide these rights in state law so that pregnant patients in Washington state have the strongest protections when seeking care. The legislature finds the existing state law, including chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.400'>70.400</a> RCW, along with current federal laws ensure that both physicians and hospitals have a shared responsibility to deliver the highest quality of care to pregnant patients to guarantee their legal access to all medically appropriate options.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.41'>70.41</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->When providing emergency services, hospitals shall provide treatment to a pregnant person who comes to the hospital with an emergency medical condition that is consistent with the applicable standard of care for such condition or, if authorized by law, transfer the patient to another hospital capable of providing the treatment, with the informed consent of the patient.

No hospital which maintains an emergency department shall transfer a patient with an emergency medical condition or who is in active labor unless the transfer is performed at the request of the patient or is due to the limited medical resources of the transferring hospital.

Hospitals may not impose application procedures for charity care or for assistance with retroactive coverage applications which place an unreasonable burden upon the patient or guarantor, taking into account any physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory deficiencies, or language barriers which may hinder the responsible party's capability of complying with application procedures.

Only those facts relevant to eligibility may be verified and duplicate forms of verification may not be demanded.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) In considering monetary assets, one current account statement shall be considered sufficient for a hospital to verify a patient's assets.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) In the event that no documentation for an asset is available, a hospital shall rely upon a written and signed statement from the responsible party.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Asset information obtained by the hospital in evaluating a patient for charity care eligibility shall not be used for collection activities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Nothing in this section prevents a hospital from considering assets as required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services related to medicare cost reporting.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) Each hospital shall post and prominently display notice of charity care availability.
