The determination of a child's best interest in these cases first requires that existing best interest factors be evaluated in light of the domestic violence or child abuse and requires consideration of the additional factors in subsection (4) of this section. This section sets forth the analysis and findings a court shall undertake if domestic violence or child abuse is present or alleged at any time during a case, based on the preponderance of the evidence, in which child custody and parenting time between the parents is at issue.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(2) GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) In entering a permanent parenting plan, the court shall not draw any presumptions from the provisions of the temporary parenting plan.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) In determining whether any of the conduct described in this section or section 2 of this act has occurred, the court shall apply the rules of evidence and civil procedure except where the parties have opted for an informal family law trial pursuant to state or local court rules.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(3) DEFINITIONS.</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section and section 2 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) "Child" shall also mean "children."</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) "Domestic abuse" means child abuse or domestic violence as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105.010'>7.105.010</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) "Knowingly" means knows or reasonably should know.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(d) "Limitation" means a provision, requirement, or order placed on an abusive parent.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(e) "Parenting functions" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09.004'>26.09.004</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(f) "Protective actions" are actions taken by a parent in good faith for the purpose of protecting themselves or the parent's child from the risk of harm posed by the other parent.

A parent who is abused is exempt from any best interest factor or presumption requiring such willingness; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iii) Evidence that the parent who is abused suffers from the effects of the abuse by the other parent. This evidence may not be the basis for denying a parent who is abused custody or parenting time including, but not limited to, a discretionary finding in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09.187'>26.09.187</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) The court may not, primarily in order to improve a deficient relationship with the other parent:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) Remove the child from a parent who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive, and with whom the child is bonded; or</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) Restrict contact between the child and a parent who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive, and with whom the child is bonded.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) The court may not remove the child from a competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive parent or restrict contact between the child and a competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive parent solely on the basis of protective actions taken by a competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive parent.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(6) MUTUAL ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. If both parents present evidence that the other parent has engaged in acts of domestic abuse, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing regarding the allegations. If the court makes a finding that both parents have engaged in acts of domestic abuse, the court shall assess and make findings regarding the following factors to assist in determining the parent that poses the lesser risk to the child and is less likely to commit acts of domestic abuse in the future:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) The nature and effects of the abuse on either parent, including whether either party has engaged in coercive control;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) Whether any physical act was in response to domestic abuse by the other parent;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) The impact of the domestic abuse on parenting behaviors and attributes;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(d) The effect on the child of the domestic abuse perpetrated by each parent; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(e) The likelihood of future acts of domestic abuse being perpetrated by either parent based on that parent's history.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(7) PARENTAL CONDUCT REQUIRING LIMITS ON DISPUTE RESOLUTION, A PARENT'S DECISION MAKING, AND A PARENT'S RESIDENTIAL TIME.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) Conduct Requiring Limitations.

Required limitations and considerations for a parent who has been convicted of a sex offense against a child or found to have sexually abused a child in the current case or a prior case are addressed in section 2 of this act.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) Mandatory Dispute Resolution Limitations. The permanent parenting plan must not designate a dispute resolution process other than court action. There is no rebuttable presumption. The court may not require face-to-face mediation, arbitration, or interventions, including therapeutic interventions, that require the parties to share the same physical or virtual space if there has been a finding of domestic violence.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) Mandatory Decision-Making Limitations. The permanent parenting plan must not require mutual decision making. There is no rebuttable presumption. Where there has been a finding of domestic violence, including against a primary aggressor parent, sole decision making must be awarded to the other parent and not to the parent against whom a domestic violence finding has been made.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(d) Mandatory Residential Time Limitations. There is a rebuttable presumption that the permanent parenting plan cannot require joint residential time with or grant sole residential time to the abusive parent.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(e) Allowing Access. If the court grants any type of custody or parenting time to a parent who perpetrated domestic abuse or child abuse, whether after a hearing or by agreement between the parents, the court shall:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) Grant majority custody to the party who is not abusive. The court may only grant majority custody to the party who is abusive if it is by agreement of the parties and the court deems it safe for the child; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) Make detailed findings regarding how the custody or parenting time ordered by the court adequately protects the child and the parent who is abused from the risk of future harm and addresses the effects of the domestic abuse or child abuse.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(8) PARENT RESIDING WITH A PERSON WHOSE CONDUCT MAY REQUIRE RESIDENTIAL TIME LIMITATIONS.</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> A</span> parent's residential time with the child shall be limited if it is found that the parent <span style="text-decoration:underline;">knowingly resides with a person who</span> has engaged in any of the following conduct: ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(i) Willful abandonment that continues for an extended period of time or substantial refusal to perform parenting functions;

The court shall only permit supervision by an individual or program that is committed to protecting the child from any physical or emotional abuse or harm and is willing and capable of intervening in behaviors inconsistent with the court orders and guidelines.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(C) A parent may seek an emergency ex parte order temporarily suspending residential time until review by the court if: (I) The supervised parent repeatedly violates the court order or guidelines; (II) the supervised parent threatens the supervisor or child with physical harm, commits an act of domestic violence, or materially violates any treatment condition associated with any restrictions under this section (a missed counseling appointment does not constitute a violation); (III) the supervisor is unable or unwilling to protect the child and/or the protected parent; or (IV) the supervisor is no longer willing to provide service to the supervised parent. The court suspending residential time shall set a review hearing to take place within 14 days of entering the ex parte order.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) Evaluation Or Treatment.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(A) Where appropriate, the court may condition residential time on successful completion of a program of intervention for parents who abuse their partners or children, including programs focused on the impact of domestic violence on children and ways to promote safe, positive parenting, or other state-certified domestic violence perpetrator treatment programs approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.20A.735'>43.20A.735</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(B) The court shall determine whether a parent has successfully completed a program described in (c)(ii)(A) of this subsection based on information provided by the program director regarding the participation of the abusive parent in the program and with collateral input provided from the other parent. Any evaluation report that does not include collateral input must provide details as to why and the attempts made to obtain collateral input.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(C) The court may refer, but may not order, a parent who is abused to receive services relating to the impact of current or past domestic violence on the parent who is abused and the child.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(D) A parent's residential time may be conditioned on the parent's completion of an evaluation or treatment ordered by the court.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iii) No Contact. If, based on the evidence, the court expressly finds that limitations on the residential time with a child will not adequately protect a child from the harm or abuse that could result if a child has contact with the parent requesting residential time, the court shall restrain the parent requesting residential time from all contact with a child.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(10) DETERMINATION NOT TO IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON RESIDENTIAL TIME. This subsection does not apply to findings of sexual abuse which are governed by section 2 of this act.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) Determining Whether The Presumption Is Rebutted. If the court grants any type of residential time to a parent who perpetrated domestic violence or child abuse, whether after a hearing or by agreement between the parents, the court shall make detailed written findings regarding how the custody or parenting time ordered by the court adequately protects the child and the parent who is abused from the risk of future harm and addresses the effects of the domestic violence or child abuse.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) In determining whether the parent who has engaged in abuse has rebutted a statutory presumption against residential time, the court shall consider and make express written findings on all of the following factors:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(A) The nature and context of the domestic violence involving the parents, parenting behaviors and attributes, and the effects of the abuse on the child's well-being;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(B) Any current risk posed by the parent to the well-being of the child or other parent;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(C) Whether the parent who engaged in domestic abuse has demonstrated that they can and will prioritize the child's well-being;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(D) Whether the parent has adhered to and is likely to adhere to court orders;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(E) Whether the parent who is abusive has genuinely acknowledged past harm and is committed to avoiding harm in the future and has made the necessary changes; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(F) A parent's compliance with any previously court-ordered treatment. A parent's compliance with the requirements for participation in a treatment program does not, by itself, constitute evidence that the parent has made the requisite changes.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) Regardless of whether the domestic violence presumption against residential time is rebutted, the court shall consider the best interest of the child factors as outlined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09.187'>26.09.187</a> before making decisions related to custody and parenting time.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b) Requirement For Specific Findings On The Record. If a court grants parenting time to a parent who engaged in domestic abuse, the court shall make specific written findings on the record that detail:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) The factors in (a) of this subsection that rebut the domestic violence presumption and therefore allow for the custody or parenting time;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) That such factors are not based on a criterion in subsection (5) of this section;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iii) How the order will promote the child's well-being; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iv) How the order will protect the other parent from harm posed by the parent who is abusive.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(c) Once The Presumption Has Been Rebutted.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(i) After the court has considered the specific factors related to domestic violence as outlined in subsection (4) of this section and determined that it is in the child's best interest for the abusive parent to have parenting time or visitation, a court shall order appropriate residential time provisions to promote the safety and well-being of the child and the parent who is abused, as set forth in this section.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) The court shall set out in the initial order not only the protective provisions and duration, but also the necessary behavioral changes that would support a modification of the order.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iii) Whether or not residential time is allowed, the court may, at the request of a party or on its own, order that specific information be kept confidential.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(iv) The court shall determine and order specific protective measures needed for contact, exchange, and parenting time or visitation.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(v) The court should impose, to the extent possible, measures that will provide the safest conditions that promote the safety and well-being of the child and abused parent for the parent who is abusive to have the residential time ordered by the court.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(vi) Where appropriate, the court may order that exchanges of children between the parents be supervised, without supervision of the parenting time or visitation. There is a presumption that the supervision of the exchange must be provided by a professional supervisor. This presumption is overcome if the court finds that:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(A) There is a layperson who has demonstrated through sworn testimony and evidence of past interactions with children that they are capable of and committed to protecting the child from physical or emotional abuse or harm during the exchange; and</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(B) The parent is unable to access professional exchange supervision due to (I) geographic isolation or other factors that would make professionally supervised exchange inaccessible or (II) financial indigency that has been demonstrated by a general rule 34 waiver or other evidence that the parent's current income and necessary expenses do not allow for the cost of professional exchange supervision.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(vii) Where necessary to protect the safety and well-being of the child and the parent who is abused, the court may order supervised parenting time or visitation in compliance with subsection (9) of this section.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(viii) A court order for supervised visitation or supervised exchange should include specific protective measures for arrival and departure at the visitation or exchange location.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ix) Whether or not the court has imposed a required level of supervision for residential time or exchange, the court shall order conditions necessary to promote and enhance the safety and well-being</span></div><div style="text-indent:0pt;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">of the child and the parent who is abused. The court should ensure such conditions are met and continue to be met for the duration of the court order. Prohibitions and requirements that may be imposed upon the parent who is abusive as a condition of residential time include, but are not limited to:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(A) Prohibiting possession or consumption of alcohol or controlled substances during the residential time and for 24 hours preceding the parenting time or visitation;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(B) Requiring surrender of all firearms and ammunition for a period of time determined by the court for the safety of the child and the parent who is abused;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(C) Assessing any fees associated with the use of the court-ordered supervised visitation against the parent who is abusive, unless the fees pose a barrier to accessing the services or are an undue hardship. The court shall not assess fees related to supervision against the parent who is abused;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(D) Prohibiting overnight parenting time or visitation;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(E) Limiting communication with the child or the parent who is abused by specifying the frequency and methods of communication and the permissible reasons for such communication;</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(F) Requiring location settings or devices be used during the residential time with the parent who is abusive; or</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(G) Any other condition that is deemed necessary to provide for the safety and well-being of the child or the parent who is abused, or other family or household member.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.09'>26.09</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->This section governs limitations on residential provisions, decision-making authority, and dispute resolution when a parent, or a person the parent resides with, has been convicted of a sex offense against a child or found to have sexually abused a child.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS. If a parent has been found to be a sexually violent predator under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09'>71.09</a> RCW or under an analogous statute of any other jurisdiction, the court shall restrain the parent from contact with a child that would otherwise be allowed under this chapter.

Unless the parent rebuts the presumption, the court shall restrain the parent from contact with the parent's child except for contact that occurs outside of the convicted or adjudicated person's presence.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The court shall not enter an order allowing a parent to have contact with the child in the offender's presence if the parent resides with a person who has been found by a preponderance of the evidence in a dependency or family law action, including in the current case, to have sexually abused a child, unless the court finds that the parent accepts that the person engaged in the harmful conduct and the parent is willing to and capable of protecting the child from harm from the person and a neutral professional appointed by the court expresses an opinion relating to abuse, trauma, or the behavior of victims and perpetrators of abuse and trauma. The professional must demonstrate expertise and substantial direct experience working with victims of domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse, that is not primarily forensic in nature.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) REBUTTING THE PRESUMPTION OF NO CONTACT WHEN A PARENT RESIDES WITH OFFENDING PERSON.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The presumption established in subsection (3)(a) of this section may be rebutted only after express written findings based on clear and convincing evidence that if the child was not the victim of the sex offense committed by the person who is residing with the parent requesting residential time, (i) contact between the child and the parent residing with the convicted or adjudicated person is appropriate and that parent is able to protect the child in the presence of the convicted or adjudicated person, and (ii) the convicted or adjudicated person has provided documentation that they have successfully completed treatment for sex offenders or are engaged in and making progress in such treatment, if any was ordered by a court.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Contact If Presumption Rebutted.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) If the court finds that the parent has met the burden of rebutting the presumption under (a) of this subsection, the court may allow a parent residing with a person who has been convicted of a sex offense against a child or adjudicated of a juvenile sex offense with a child at least eight years younger to have residential time with the child in the presence of that person, supervised by a neutral and independent adult and pursuant to an adequate plan for supervision of such residential time. The supervisor may be the parent if the court finds, based on the evidence, that the parent is willing and capable of protecting the child from harm.
