(1) The legislature recognizes that people with direct lived experience are experts in their own lives and experience. The passage of the nothing about us without us act solidified our commitment to developing smart and inclusive policy with the leadership of directly impacted populations.(2) Those who are incarcerated or experiencing institutionalization face extraordinary barriers to civic participation, are most impacted by law making, and benefit greatly by participating in society. Society also benefits tremendously when the treatment or rehabilitation of directly impacted people is accelerated by their inclusion in the civic process.(3) The legislature recognizes that:(a) Individuals within state institutions remain members of society throughout the duration and beyond the conclusion of their treatment, punishment, or commitment within those institutions.(b) All justice-involved individuals, including incarcerated individuals, and individuals experiencing institutionalization, are essential stakeholders in the laws and policies affecting their lives, and the voices of these individuals must be represented in civic processes to hold a functioning democracy.(c) People who are in prisons, state hospitals, and residential habilitation centers disproportionately come from marginalized communities. Removing segments of marginalized communities from civic processes through incarceration and institutionalization has a compounding effect that perpetuates the marginalization of disadvantaged communities overall.(d) Crime is a form of divestment from society, the social order, and the common good. Involuntary treatment and institutionalization teach isolation from society when individuals are in the most need of support. Conversely, civic engagement is a form of inclusion and investment in society towards the common good.(e) Individuals experiencing incarceration and institutionalization who invest in society during their incarceration and treatment are less likely to harm society after their release. Civically engaged individuals are essential to reducing harm both during and after their sentence and treatment.(f) Civically engaged individuals help bring underrepresented communities in from the margins, strengthening the fabric of society.(g) Justice and treatment systems that value rehabilitation and inclusion in society will encourage and facilitate civic engagement and investment in the community.(4) The legislature finds that limiting the civic engagement of individuals serves no compelling governmental interest and has no legitimate penological objective.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
