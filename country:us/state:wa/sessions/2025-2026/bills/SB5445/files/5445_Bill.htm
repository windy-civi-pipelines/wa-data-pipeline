Nothing in the rule adopted under this subsection precludes a qualifying utility from using its utility specific conservation measures, values, and assumptions in identifying its achievable cost-effective conservation potential. At least every two years thereafter, the qualifying utility shall review and update this assessment for the subsequent ten-year period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Beginning January 2010, each qualifying utility shall establish and make publicly available a biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation consistent with its identification of achievable opportunities in (a) of this subsection, and meet that target during the subsequent two-year period. At a minimum, each biennial target must be no lower than the qualifying utility's pro rata share for that two-year period of its cost-effective conservation potential for the subsequent ten-year period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c)(i) Except as provided in (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, beginning on January 1, 2014, cost-effective conservation achieved by a qualifying utility in excess of its biennial acquisition target may be used to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 20 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Beginning January 1, 2014, a qualifying utility may use single large facility conservation savings in excess of its biennial target to meet up to an additional five percent of the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c)(ii), "single large facility conservation savings" means cost-effective conservation savings achieved in a single biennial period at the premises of a single customer of a qualifying utility whose annual electricity consumption prior to the conservation savings exceeded five average megawatts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, and until December 31, 2017, a qualifying utility with an industrial facility located in a county with a population between 95,000 and 115,000 that is directly interconnected with electricity facilities that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage may use cost-effective conservation from that industrial facility in excess of its biennial acquisition target to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In meeting its conservation targets, a qualifying utility may count high-efficiency cogeneration owned and used by a retail electric customer to meet its own needs. High-efficiency cogeneration is the sequential production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a common fuel source, where, under normal operating conditions, the facility has a useful thermal energy output of no less than 33 percent of the total energy output. The reduction in load due to high-efficiency cogeneration shall be: (i) Calculated as the ratio of the fuel chargeable to power heat rate of the cogeneration facility compared to the heat rate on a new and clean basis of a best-commercially available technology combined-cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbine; and (ii) counted towards meeting the biennial conservation target in the same manner as other conservation savings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) A qualifying utility is considered in compliance with its biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation in (b) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the conservation target. Events that a qualifying utility may demonstrate were beyond its reasonable control, that could not have reasonably been anticipated or ameliorated, and that prevented it from meeting the conservation target include: (i) Natural disasters resulting in the issuance of extended emergency declarations; (ii) the cancellation of significant conservation projects; and (iii) actions of a governmental authority that adversely affects the acquisition of cost-effective conservation by the qualifying utility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The commission may determine if a conservation program implemented by an investor-owned utility is cost-effective based on the commission's policies and practice.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) In addition to the requirements of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.280.030'>19.280.030</a>(3), in assessing the cost-effective conservation required under this section, a qualifying utility is encouraged to promote the adoption of air conditioning, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.60.010'>70A.60.010</a>, with refrigerants not exceeding a global warming potential of 750 and the replacement of stationary refrigeration systems that contain ozone-depleting substances or hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants with a high global warming potential.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) The commission may rely on its standard practice for review and approval of investor-owned utility conservation targets.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) Except as provided in (j) of this subsection, each qualifying utility shall use eligible renewable resources or acquire equivalent renewable energy credits, or any combination of them, to meet the following annual targets:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) At least three percent of its load by January 1, 2012, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2015;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) At least nine percent of its load by January 1, 2016, and each year thereafter through December 31, 2019;

or (ii) has contracted to purchase the associated renewable energy credits.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) In meeting the annual targets in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility shall calculate its annual load based on the average of the utility's load for the previous two years.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if: (i) The utility's weather-adjusted load for the previous three years on average did not increase over that time period; (ii) after December 7, 2006, the utility did not commence or renew ownership or incremental purchases of electricity from resources other than coal transition power or renewable resources other than on a daily spot price basis and the electricity is not offset by equivalent renewable energy credits; and (iii) the utility invested at least one percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement that year on eligible renewable resources, renewable energy credits, or a combination of both.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) A qualifying utility may use renewable energy credits to meet the requirements of this section, subject to the limitations of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by a resource other than freshwater may be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created, the year before the year in which the credit was created, or the year after the year in which the credit was created.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A renewable energy credit from electricity generated by freshwater:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) May only be used to meet a requirement applicable to the year in which the credit was created; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) Must be acquired by the qualifying utility through ownership of the generation facility or through a transaction that conveyed both the electricity and the nonpower attributes of the electricity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) A renewable energy credit transferred to an investor-owned utility pursuant to the Bonneville power administration's residential exchange program may not be used by any utility other than the utility receiving the credit from the Bonneville power administration.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Each renewable energy credit may only be used once to meet the requirements of this section and must be retired using procedures of the renewable energy credit tracking system.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) In complying with the targets established in (a) of this subsection, a qualifying utility may not count:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Eligible renewable resources or distributed generation where the associated renewable energy credits are owned by a separate entity; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Eligible renewable resources or renewable energy credits obtained for and used in an optional pricing program such as the program established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.29A.090'>19.29A.090</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Where fossil and combustible renewable resources are cofired in one generating unit located in the Pacific Northwest where the cofiring commenced after March 31, 1999, the unit shall be considered to produce eligible renewable resources in direct proportion to the percentage of the total heat value represented by the heat value of the renewable resources.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h)(i) A qualifying utility that acquires an eligible renewable resource or renewable energy credit may count that acquisition at one and two-tenths times its base value:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) Where the eligible renewable resource comes from a facility that commenced operation after December 31, 2005; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) Where the developer of the facility used apprenticeship programs approved by the council during facility construction.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The council shall establish minimum levels of labor hours to be met through apprenticeship programs to qualify for this extra credit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with an annual target in (a) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the renewable energy target. Such events include weather-related damage, mechanical failure, strikes, lockouts, and actions of a governmental authority that adversely affect the generation, transmission, or distribution of an eligible renewable resource under contract to a qualifying utility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j)(i) Beginning January 1, 2016, only a qualifying utility that owns or is directly interconnected to a qualified biomass energy facility may use qualified biomass energy to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A qualifying utility may no longer use electricity and associated renewable energy credits from a qualified biomass energy facility if the associated industrial pulping or wood manufacturing facility ceases operation other than for purposes of maintenance or upgrade.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) An industrial facility that hosts a qualified biomass energy facility may only transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy generated at its facility to the qualifying utility with which it is directly interconnected with facilities owned by such a qualifying utility and that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage. The qualifying utility may only use an amount of renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy that are equivalent to the proportionate amount of its annual targets under (a)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection that was created by the load of the industrial facility. A qualifying utility that owns a qualified biomass energy facility may not transfer or sell renewable energy credits associated with qualified biomass energy to another person, entity, or qualifying utility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">A qualifying utility shall be considered in compliance with the annual target in subsection (2)(a) of this section if the qualifying utility cumulatively invests at least two percent of its total annual retail revenue requirement in local energy resilience projects.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(m)</span> Beginning January 1, 2020, a qualifying utility may use eligible renewable resources as identified under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.285.030'>19.285.030</a>(12) (g) and (h) to meet its compliance obligation under this subsection (2).
