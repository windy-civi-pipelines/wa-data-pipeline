These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production. Incentivizing distributed energy can help us protect our rich agricultural lands and meet our clean energy goals.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2)(a) The legislature finds and declares that the Pacific Northwest utilities conference committee has estimated demand for electricity in the region will increase 30 percent over the next decade. High-tech manufacturing, increasing electrification of buildings and transportation, and surging data center needs contribute to the expected increase in demand. Local economies benefit from projects that will help meet this demand and improve distribution system resilience with local resources and investments.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The legislature further finds and declares that utilities are essential partners in achieving the state's decarbonization goals while meeting increasing demand and ensuring grid reliability. Such projects can create high quality jobs, provide opportunities for training apprentice workers, and help utilities leverage their own expertise, community relationships, and resources to address our energy challenges.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The legislature intends to support utilities who make significant investments in energy resilience by establishing an alternate compliance pathway in the energy independence act for utilities who invest in distributed energy priority projects.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21F'>43.21F</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The following categories of clean energy facilities and nonproject activities that reduce environmental impacts are determined to constitute distributed energy priorities:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Solar energy generation and accompanying energy storage and electricity transmission and distribution, including vehicle charging equipment, when such facilities are located:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of electrical transmission facilities;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of a state highway or city or county road;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) On structures over or enclosing irrigation canals, drainage ditches, and irrigation, agricultural, livestock supply, stormwater, or wastewater reservoirs or similar impoundments of state waters that do not host salmon or steelhead trout runs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) On elevated structures over parking lots;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) On lands within a transportation facility, including but not limited to airports and railroad facilities, or restricted from other developments by transportation facility operations;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) On closed or capped portions of landfills;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) On reclaimed or former surface mine lands or contaminated sites that have been remediated under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.305'>70A.305</a> RCW or the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C.

Nothing in the rule adopted under this subsection precludes a qualifying utility from using its utility specific conservation measures, values, and assumptions in identifying its achievable cost-effective conservation potential. At least every two years thereafter, the qualifying utility shall review and update this assessment for the subsequent ten-year period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Beginning January 2010, each qualifying utility shall establish and make publicly available a biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation consistent with its identification of achievable opportunities in (a) of this subsection, and meet that target during the subsequent two-year period. At a minimum, each biennial target must be no lower than the qualifying utility's pro rata share for that two-year period of its cost-effective conservation potential for the subsequent ten-year period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c)(i) Except as provided in (c)(ii) and (iii) of this subsection, beginning on January 1, 2014, cost-effective conservation achieved by a qualifying utility in excess of its biennial acquisition target may be used to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 20 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Beginning January 1, 2014, a qualifying utility may use single large facility conservation savings in excess of its biennial target to meet up to an additional five percent of the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined. For the purposes of this subsection (1)(c)(ii), "single large facility conservation savings" means cost-effective conservation savings achieved in a single biennial period at the premises of a single customer of a qualifying utility whose annual electricity consumption prior to the conservation savings exceeded five average megawatts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Beginning January 1, 2012, and until December 31, 2017, a qualifying utility with an industrial facility located in a county with a population between 95,000 and 115,000 that is directly interconnected with electricity facilities that are capable of carrying electricity at transmission voltage may use cost-effective conservation from that industrial facility in excess of its biennial acquisition target to help meet the immediately subsequent two biennial acquisition targets, such that no more than 25 percent of any biennial target may be met with excess conservation savings allowed under all of the provisions of this section combined.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In meeting its conservation targets, a qualifying utility may count high-efficiency cogeneration owned and used by a retail electric customer to meet its own needs. High-efficiency cogeneration is the sequential production of electricity and useful thermal energy from a common fuel source, where, under normal operating conditions, the facility has a useful thermal energy output of no less than 33 percent of the total energy output. The reduction in load due to high-efficiency cogeneration shall be: (i) Calculated as the ratio of the fuel chargeable to power heat rate of the cogeneration facility compared to the heat rate on a new and clean basis of a best-commercially available technology combined-cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbine; and (ii) counted towards meeting the biennial conservation target in the same manner as other conservation savings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) A qualifying utility is considered in compliance with its biennial acquisition target for cost-effective conservation in (b) of this subsection if events beyond the reasonable control of the utility that could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated prevented it from meeting the conservation target.
