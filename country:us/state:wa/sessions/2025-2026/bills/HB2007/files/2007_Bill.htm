The graduation pathway options are intended to provide a student with multiple ways, including test-based, course-based, and performance-based options, to demonstrate readiness in furtherance of the student's individual goals for high school and beyond. For the purposes of this section, "demonstrate readiness" means the student meets or exceeds state learning standards addressed in the graduation pathway option. A student may choose to pursue one or more of the graduation pathway options under subsection (2) of this section, but any graduation pathway option used by a student to demonstrate career and college readiness must be in alignment with the student's high school and beyond plan.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The following graduation pathway options may be used to demonstrate career and college readiness:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Meet or exceed the graduation standard established by the state board of education under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.305.130'>28A.305.130</a> on the statewide high school assessments in English language arts and mathematics as provided for under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655.070'>28A.655.070</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Complete and qualify for college credit in dual credit courses in English language arts and mathematics. For the purposes of this subsection, "dual credit course" means a course in which a student qualifies for college and high school credit in English language arts or mathematics upon successfully completing the course;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Earn high school credit in a high school transition course in English language arts and mathematics, an example of which includes a bridge to college course.

High school transition courses must satisfy core or elective credit graduation requirements established by the state board of education. A student's successful completion of a high school transition course does not entitle the student to be admitted to an institution of higher education as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Earn high school credit, with a C+ grade or higher in AP, international baccalaureate, or Cambridge international courses<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, or in competency-based assessments</span> in English language arts and mathematics; or earn at least the minimum scores outlined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.054'>28B.10.054</a>(1) on the corresponding exams.
