Peers deal in the currency of hope and motivation<span style="text-decoration:underline;">. Peers bring hope to individuals receiving services</span> and are incredibly adept at supporting people with behavioral health challenges on their recovery journeys. Peers represent the only segment of the behavioral health workforce where there is not a shortage, but a surplus of willing workers. Peers, however, are presently limited to serving only medicaid recipients and working only in community behavioral health agencies. As a result, youth and adults with commercial insurance have no access to peer services.

For behavioral health agencies, an effective plan of treatment for most persons with opioid use disorder integrates access to medications and psychosocial counseling and should be consistent with the American society of addiction medicine patient placement criteria. Providers must inform patients with opioid use disorder or substance use disorder of options to access federal food and drug administration approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder or substance use disorder. Because some such medications are controlled substances in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50'>69.50</a> RCW, the state of Washington maintains the legal obligation and right to regulate the uses of these medications in the treatment of opioid use disorder.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The authority must work with other state agencies and stakeholders to develop value-based payment strategies to better support the ongoing care of persons with opioid and other substance use disorders.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The department of corrections shall develop policies to prioritize services based on available grant funding and funds appropriated specifically for opioid use disorder treatment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The authority must promote the use of medication therapies and other evidence-based strategies to address the opioid epidemic in Washington state.
