The legislature finds that decarbonization policies and artificial intelligence applications have accelerated demand on Washington's electricity grid. Nuclear energy provides significant value to a decarbonized grid; it is a clean firm complement to renewable resources, has low land-use requirements while producing energy at scale, and offers high-paying jobs and regional economic benefits. Therefore, the legislature finds that nuclear energy will play an essential role in the energy transition. </span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->It is the intent of the legislature that a new nuclear energy advisory commission shall provide a credible resource on nuclear energy to the people of the state of Washington and support the growth of the nuclear energy industry.
