FOR THE CONSERVATION COMMISSION2025-2027 Voluntary Riparian Grant Program (40000049)The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations:(1) The appropriation in this section is provided solely for the state conservation commission to provide grants for riparian restoration projects with landowners.(2)(a) Within funds appropriated in this section, the commission shall develop and implement the voluntary riparian grant program to fund protection and restoration of critical riparian management zones. The commission is responsible for developing the voluntary grant program criteria to achieve optimal restoration of functioning riparian ecosystems in priority critical riparian management zones.(b) In adopting program criteria, the commission shall:(i) Invite federally recognized tribes to be full participants;(ii) Coordinate with private landowners and other interested stakeholders;(iii) Coordinate with the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, conservation districts, and the department of agriculture; and(iv) Consider the best available, locally applicable science that is specific to each region of the state where the program criteria will be applied.(3) The commission shall prioritize critical riparian management zones at the watershed or subbasin scale where grant funding under the program would be primarily targeted. The prioritization must be informed by, consistent with, and aligned with one or more of the following: Watershed plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.82 RCW; the action agenda developed under RCW 90.71.260; regional recovery plans created under RCW 77.85.090; the habitat project lists developed pursuant to RCW 77.85.050; the prioritization process developed under RCW 77.95.160; and priority projects identified for salmon recovery through agency grant programs.(4) Conditions for awarding funding for projects under this program include, but are not limited to:(a) Consistency with the program criteria established under subsection (2) of this section;(b) Tiered incentive rates tied to improving functionality for riparian areas; and(c) Other requirements as determined by the commission.(5) The commission must distribute riparian grant program funding equitably throughout the state, consistent with received grant applications and benefit to salmon habitat. The legislature intends for funding to be primarily for projects located in salmon recovery regions, as defined in RCW 77.85.010, but funding may also be distributed to a project not located in a salmon recovery region upon a determination by the commission that the project will provide a unique benefit to salmon habitat.(6) Allowable expenses to a grantee receiving funds under this section include, but are not limited to, labor, equipment, fencing, mulch, seed, seedling trees, manual weed control, and yearly maintenance costs for up to 10 years.(7) Any native woody trees and shrubs planted with funding provided under this section must be maintained for a minimum of five years or as otherwise set by the commission for each grantee. Vegetation must be chosen to prevent invasive weed populations and ensure survival and successful establishment of plantings.(8) The commission shall determine appropriate recordkeeping and data collection procedures required for program implementation and shall establish a data management system that allows for coordination between the commission and other state agencies. Any data collected or shared under this section may be used only to assess the success of the riparian grant program in improving the functions of critical riparian habitat.(9) The commission shall develop and implement a framework that includes monitoring, adaptive management, and metrics in order to ensure consistency with the requirements of the riparian grant program. The monitoring and adaptive management framework may include, but is not limited to, consideration of:(a) Acres identified as eligible for restoration within a watershed;(b) Acres planned to be restored;(c) Acres actually planted and maintained;(d) Success in targeting and achieving aggregated project implementation resulting in an increase in linear miles restored;(e) Plan review criteria; and(f) Other similar factors as identified by the commission.(10) The commission may use up to two percent of any amounts appropriated in this section for targeted outreach activities that focus on critically identified geographic locations for listed salmon species.(11) The commission may use up to four percent of amounts appropriated in this section for administrative expenses.(12) For the purposes of this section, "critical riparian management zone" means the area adjacent to freshwaters, wetlands, and marine waters that has been locally or regionally identified as an area where salmon recovery efforts would significantly benefit from enhanced protection or restoration.Appropriation:Natural Climate Solutions AccountâState. . . .$20,000,000Prior Biennia (Expenditures). . . .$0Future Biennia (Projected Costs). . . .$80,000,000TOTAL. . . .$100,000,000NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3076.

FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTIONSCAPR Transitional Projects (91002551)The appropriations in this section are subject to the following conditions and limitations:(1) It is the intent of the legislature to work with the office of the superintendent of public instruction and stakeholders to revise the school construction assistance program and to holistically examine the state's programmatic support of K-12 school construction through the planning process required under section 5011, chapter 375, Laws of 2024. Pursuant to this section, the legislature intends that this revision and examination will be completed in a manner that will modify and improve efficiencies within, and access to, the school construction assistance program, while also identifying cost-saving measures for awarding state grants for the construction and modernization of common school facilities. The legislature further intends that this revision and planning process will result in a prioritized list of school construction projects that recognizes the substantial variation between district sizes and financial capacities, and which categorizes reasonably comparable applicants into distinct school district groupings to foster a fair and equitable prioritization of projects. However, the legislature also recognizes that some school district projects will be ready to proceed to construction during this planning and revision period. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide funding to the school district projects listed in this section in recognition of this transitional period.(2) School districts receiving grant funding pursuant to this section may combine this funding with a school construction assistance program grant and must use available local resources to contribute financially to the completion of the project.(3) $8,131,000 of the common school construction accountâstate appropriation in this section is provided solely for the Pe Ell school district's K-12 school modernization project.(4) $6,000,000 of the common school construction accountâstate appropriation in this section is provided solely for the Bridgeport school district's Bridgeport elementary school modernization project.(5) $3,972,000 of the common school construction accountâstate appropriation and $6,000,000 of the state building construction accountâstate appropriation in this section are provided solely for the Inchelium school district's K-12 school modernization project.(6) Grant funding provided to each school district in this section is contingent upon each of the applicable districts named in this section relinquishing all unspent construction grant funding previously awarded under section 7063 of this act.Appropriation:Common School Construction FundâState. . . .$18,103,000State Building Construction AccountâState. . . .$6,000,000Subtotal Appropriation. . . .$24,103,000Prior Biennia (Expenditures). . . .$0Future Biennia (Projected Costs). . . .$0TOTAL. . . .$24,103,000NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 5013.

RCW 43.88.031 requires the disclosure of the estimated debt service costs associated with new capital bond appropriations. The estimated debt service costs for the appropriations contained in this act are $76,105,816 for the 2025-2027 biennium, $425,999,496 for the 2027-2029 biennium, and $655,708,813 for the 2029-2031 biennium.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8002. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES THROUGH FINANCIAL CONTRACTS.(1) The following agencies may enter into financial contracts, paid from any funds of an agency, appropriated or nonappropriated, for the purposes indicated and in not more than the principal amounts indicated, plus financing expenses and required reserves pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW. When securing properties under this section, agencies shall use the most economical financial contract option available, including long-term leases, lease-purchase agreements, lease-development with option to purchase agreements or financial contracts using certificates of participation. Expenditures made by an agency for one of the indicated purposes before the issue date of the authorized financial contract and any certificates of participation therein are intended to be reimbursed from proceeds of the financial contract and any certificates of participation therein to the extent provided in the agency's financing plan approved by the state finance committee.(2) Those noninstructional facilities of higher education institutions authorized in this section to enter into financial contracts are not eligible for state funded maintenance and operations. Instructional space that is available for regularly scheduled classes for academic transfer, basic skills, and workforce training programs may be eligible for state funded maintenance and operations.(3) Western Washington University: Enter into a financing contract for up to $3,000,000 plus financing expenses, required reserves, and capitalized interest pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to construct a parking lot replacement. (4) Community and technical colleges: (a) Enter into a financing contract on behalf of Columbia Basin College for up to $18,000,000 plus financing expenses, required reserves, and capitalized interest pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to construct student housing.

(1) To ensure that major construction projects are carried out in accordance with legislative and executive intent, agencies must complete a predesign for state construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000. For purposes of this section, "total anticipated cost" means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project.(2) Appropriations for design may not be expended or encumbered until the office of financial management has reviewed and approved the agency's predesign.(3) The predesign must explore at least three project alternatives. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. The chosen alternative should be the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The predesign document must include, but not be limited to, program, site, and cost analysis, and an analysis of the life-cycle costs of the alternatives explored, in accordance with the predesign manual adopted by the office of financial management.(4) For projects exceeding the $10,000,000 predesign threshold established in this section, the office of financial management may make an exception to some or all of the predesign requirements in this section. The office of financial management shall report any exception to the fiscal committees of the legislature:(a) A description of the major capital project for which the predesign waiver is made;(b) An explanation of the reason for the waiver; and(c) A rough order of magnitude cost estimate for the project's design and construction.(5) In deliberations related to submitting an exception under this section, the office of financial management shall consider the following factors:(a) Whether there is any determination to be made regarding the site of the project;(b) Whether there is any determination to be made regarding whether the project will involve renovation, new construction, or both;(c) Whether, within six years of submitting the request for funding, the agency has completed, or initiated the construction of, a substantially similar project;(d) Whether there is any anticipated change to the project's program or the services to be delivered at the facility;(e) Whether the requesting agency indicates that the project may not require some or all of the predesign requirements in this section due to a lack of complexity; and(f) Whether any other factors related to project complexity or risk, as determined by the office of financial management, could reduce the need for, or scope of, a predesign.(6) If under this section, some or all predesign requirements are waived, the office of financial management may instead propose a professional project cost estimate instead of a request for predesign funding.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8004. (1) The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.(2) Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. Agencies must choose the most reasonable and cost-effective solution, as supported by the life-cycle cost analysis. A brief description of each project alternative and why it was chosen must be included in the life-cycle cost analysis section of the predesign.(3) The office of financial management shall: (a) Make available a life-cycle cost model to be used for analysis; (b) in consultation with the department of enterprise services, provide assistance in using the life-cycle cost model; and (c) update the life-cycle cost model annually including assumptions for inflation rates, discount rates, and energy rates.(4) Agencies shall consider architectural and engineering firms' and general contractors' experience using life-cycle costs, operating costs, and energy efficiency measures when selecting an architectural and engineering firm, or when selecting contractors using alternative contracting methods.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8005. Agencies administering construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000 must submit progress reports to the office of financial management and to the fiscal committees of the house of representatives and senate. "Total anticipated cost" means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project. Reports must be submitted on July 1st and December 31st of each year in a format determined by the office of financial management. After the project is completed, agencies must also submit a closeout report that identifies the total project cost and any unspent appropriations.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8006. (1) Allotments for appropriations in this act shall be provided in accordance with the capital project review requirements adopted by the office of financial management and in compliance with RCW 43.88.110. Projects that will be employing alternative public works construction procedures under chapter 39.10 RCW are subject to the allotment procedures defined in this section and RCW 43.88.110.(2) Each project is defined as proposed in the legislative budget notes or in the governor's budget document.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8007. (1) The office of financial management may authorize a transfer of appropriation authority provided for a capital project that is in excess of the amount required for the completion of such project to another capital project for which the appropriation is insufficient. No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity of any facility beyond that intended in making the appropriation. Such transfers may be effected only between capital appropriations to a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education and only between capital projects that are funded from the same fund or account. No transfers may occur between projects to local government agencies except where the grants are provided within a single omnibus appropriation and where such transfers are specifically authorized by the implementing statutes that govern the grants.(2) The office of financial management may find that an amount is in excess of the amount required for the completion of a project only if: (a) The project as defined in the notes to the budget document is substantially complete and there are funds remaining; or (b) bids have been let on a project and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project as defined in the notes to the budget document can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated in this act.(3) For the purposes of this section, the intent is that each project be defined as proposed to the legislature in the governor's budget document, unless it clearly appears from the legislative history that the legislature intended to define the scope of a project in a different way.(4) A report of any transfer effected under this section, except emergency projects or any transfer under $250,000, shall be filed with the fiscal committees of the legislature by the office of financial management at least 30 days before the date the transfer is effected. The office of financial management shall report all emergency or smaller transfers within 30 days from the date of transfer.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8008. (1) It is expected that projects be ready to proceed in a timely manner depending on the type or phase of the project or program that is the subject of the appropriation in this act. Except for major projects that customarily may take more than two biennia to complete from predesign to the end of construction, or large infrastructure grant or loan programs supporting projects that often take more than two biennia to complete, the legislature generally does not intend to reappropriate funds more than once, particularly for smaller grant programs, local/community projects, and minor works.(2) Agencies shall expedite the expenditure of reappropriations and appropriations in this act in order to: (a) Rehabilitate infrastructure resources; (b) accelerate environmental rehabilitation and restoration projects for the improvement of the state's natural environment; (c) reduce additional costs associated with acquisition and construction inflationary pressures; and (d) provide additional employment opportunities associated with capital expenditures.(3) To the extent feasible, agencies are directed to accelerate expenditure rates at their current level of permanent employees and shall use contracted design and construction services wherever necessary to meet the goals of this section.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8009. Any building project that receives over $10,000,000 in funding from the capital budget must be built to sustainable standards. "Sustainable building" means a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:(1) Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building. Consider all stages of the building's life-cycle, including deconstruction.(2) Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.(3) Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by 50 percent below prerenovation baseline.(4) On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.(5) High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.(6) Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used. Where appropriate, install dashboards inside buildings to display and incentivize occupants on energy use.(7) Benchmarking: Compare performance data from the first year of operation with the energy design target. Verify that the building performance meets or exceeds the design target. For other building and space types, use an equivalent benchmarking tool.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8010. State agencies, including institutions of higher education, shall allot and report full-time equivalent staff for capital projects in a manner comparable to staff reporting for operating expenditures.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8011. Executive Order No. 21-02, archaeological and cultural resources, was issued effective April 7, 2021. Agencies shall comply with the requirements set forth in this executive order and must consult with the department of archaeology and historic preservation and affected tribes on the potential effects of projects on cultural resources and historic properties proposed in state-funded construction or acquisition projects, including grant or pass-through funding that culminates in construction or land acquisitions. Consultation with the department of archaeology and historic preservation and affected tribes must be initiated early in the project planning process, prior to construction or taking title.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8012. FOR THE ARTS COMMISSIONâART WORK ALLOWANCE.(1) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction of school plant facilities is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 28A.335.210.(2) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction, or any major renovation or remodel work exceeding $200,000 by colleges or universities is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 28B.10.027.(3) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction of any public building by a state agency identified in RCW 43.17.200 is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 43.17.200.(4) At least 75 percent of the moneys spent by the Washington state arts commission during the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium for the purposes of RCW 28A.335.210, 28B.10.027, and 43.17.200 must be expended solely for direct acquisition of works of art; no more than 20 percent may be expended for program administration; and no more than four percent may be expended to conserve or maintain existing pieces in the state art collection.(5) Beginning with new appropriations made in the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, art allocations not expended by the end of the second full fiscal biennium from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall lapse, except for art allocations made under K-3 class size reduction grants under section 6313 of this act.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8013. To carry out the provisions of this act, the governor may assign responsibility for predesign, design, construction, and other related activities to any appropriate agency.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8014. If any federal moneys appropriated by this act for capital projects are not received by the state, the department or agency to which the moneys were appropriated may replace the federal moneys with funds available from private or local sources. No replacement may occur under this section without the prior approval of the director of financial management in consultation with the senate ways and means committee and the house of representatives capital budget committee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8015. (1) Unless otherwise stated, for all appropriations under this act that require a match of nonstate money or in-kind contributions, the following requirement, consistent with RCW 43.88.150, shall apply: Expenditures of state money shall be timed so that the state share of project expenditures never exceeds the intended state share of total project costs.(2) Provision of the full amount of required matching funds is not required to permit the expenditure of capital budget appropriations for phased projects if a proportional amount of the required matching funds is provided for each distinct, identifiable phase of the project.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8016. NONTAXABLE AND TAXABLE BOND PROCEEDS.Portions of the appropriation authority granted by this act from the state building construction account, or any other account receiving bond proceeds, may be transferred to the state taxable building construction account as deemed necessary by the state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, to comply with the federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds. Portions of the general obligation bond proceeds authorized by chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 ((H-2081.3/25) state general obligation bonds and related accounts) for deposit into the state taxable building construction account that are in excess of amounts required to comply with the federal internal revenue service rules and regulations shall be deposited into the state building construction account. The state treasurer shall submit written notification to the director of financial management and the legislative evaluation and accountability program committee if it is determined that a shift of appropriation authority between the state building construction account, or any other account receiving bond proceeds, and the state taxable building construction account is necessary, or that a shift of appropriation authority from the state taxable building construction account, or any other account receiving taxable bond proceeds, to the state building construction account may be made.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8017. (1) Minor works project lists are single line appropriations that include multiple projects of a similar nature and that are valued between $25,000 and $1,500,000 each, with the exception of higher education minor works projects that may be valued up to $2,000,000. Funds appropriated in this act for minor works may not be initially allotted until agencies submit project lists to the office of financial management for review and approval.(2) Revisions to the project lists, including the addition of projects and the transfer of funds between projects, are allowed but must be submitted to the office of financial management, the house of representatives capital budget committee, and the senate ways and means committee for review and comment, and must include an explanation of variances from prior approved lists. Any project list revisions must be approved by the office of financial management before funds may be expended from the minor works appropriation.(3)(a) All minor works projects should be completed within two years of the appropriation with the funding provided.(b) Agencies are prohibited from including projects on their minor works lists that are a phase of a larger project, and that if combined over a continuous period of time, would exceed $1,500,000, or $2,000,000 for higher education minor works projects.(c) Minor works appropriations may not be used for the following: Studies, except for technical or engineering reviews or designs that lead directly to and support a project on the same minor works list; planning; design outside the scope of work on a minor works list; movable, temporary, and traditionally funded operating equipment not in compliance with the equipment criteria established by the office of financial management; software not dedicated to control of a specialized system; moving expenses; land or facility acquisition; rolling stock; computers; or to supplement funding for projects with funding shortfalls unless expressly authorized.

The advisory committee specified in subsection (4)(a) of this section may recommend amendments to the eligibility threshold as they learn more about the characteristics of school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are unable to modernize their aging school facilities. Districts with incomplete information in the inventory and condition of schools data system are not eligible to apply for construction grants but may apply for planning grants.(3) The office of the superintendent of public instruction must assist eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are interested in applying for a small school district modernization grant under this section by providing technical assistance and planning grants within appropriations for this purpose. Districts and state-tribal education compact schools seeking planning grants must provide a brief statement of the school condition, its deficiencies, student enrollment, student achievement measures, and financial limitations of the district or state-tribal education compact school. If applications for planning grants exceed funds available, the office of the superintendent of public instruction may prioritize the recipients of planning grants in order to help districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most serious apparent building deficiencies, and the most limited financial capacity.(4) Prioritized construction grants and advisory committee.(a) The superintendent of public instruction must propose a list of prioritized grants to the governor by September 1st of even-numbered years.

The office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide administrative and staff support to the (([advisory]))advisory committee. The office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the advisory committee must design a grant application process with specific criteria for prioritizing grant requests.(b) The advisory committee created in (a) of this subsection must evaluate final applications from eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The advisory committee must submit a prioritized list of grants to the superintendent of public instruction. The list must prioritize applications to achieve the greatest improvement of school facilities, in the districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most limited financial capacity, for projects that are likely to improve student health, safety, and academic performance for the largest number of students for the amount of state grant support. The advisory committee must develop specific criteria to achieve the prioritization. The submitted prioritized list must describe the project, the proposed state funding level, and the estimated total project cost including other funding and in-kind resources. The list must also indicate student achievement measures that will be used to evaluate the benefits of the project. The superintendent of public instruction and the governor may determine the level of funding in their omnibus capital appropriations act requests to support small school district modernization grants, but their funding requests must follow the prioritized list prepared by the advisory committee unless new information determines that a specific project is no longer viable as proposed.(5) Coordination with the school construction assistance program.(a) The full administrative and procedural process of school construction assistance program funding under RCW 28A.525.162 through 28A.525.180 may be streamlined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in order to coordinate eligible school construction assistance program funding with the small school district modernization grants. Such coordination must ensure that total state funding from both grants does not exceed total project costs minus available local resources.(b) Projects seeking small school district modernization grants must meet the requirements for a school construction assistance program grant except for the following: (i) The estimated cost of the project may be less than ((forty))40 percent of the estimated replacement value of the facility, and (ii) local funding assistance percentage requirements of the school construction assistance program do not apply. However, available district and state-tribal education compact school resources are considered in prioritizing small school district modernization grants.(6) Disbursement of grant funds and reporting requirements. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must award grants to school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The grant must not be awarded until the district or state-tribal education compact school has identified available local and other resources sufficient to complete the approved project considering the amount of the state grant. The grant must specify reporting requirements from the district or state-tribal education compact school, which must include updating all pertinent information in the inventory and condition of schools data system and submitting a final project report as specified by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the school facilities citizen((s [citizen])) advisory panel specified in RCW 28A.525.025.(7) From the effective date of this section through June 30, 2027, school districts receiving a small district modernization grant under this section may not combine this grant funding either with a school construction assistance program grant or with other grants awarded under this section to fund a single project.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8040.

During the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department may remit state funding on a reimbursement basis for 100 percent of eligible project costs. Eligible housing developments are projects that have received public funding and have secured enough funding to complete construction of the project that will result in a certificate of occupancy to open the affordable housing development, including the early learning facility.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8042. If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8043.

The commission is responsible for developing the voluntary grant program criteria to achieve optimal restoration of functioning riparian ecosystems in priority critical riparian management zones.(b) In adopting program criteria, the commission shall:(i) Invite federally recognized tribes to be full participants;(ii) Coordinate with private landowners and other interested stakeholders;(iii) Coordinate with the department of ecology, the department of fish and wildlife, conservation districts, and the department of agriculture; and(iv) Consider the best available, locally applicable science that is specific to each region of the state where the program criteria will be applied.(3) The commission shall prioritize critical riparian management zones at the watershed or subbasin scale where grant funding under the program would be primarily targeted. The prioritization must be informed by, consistent with, and aligned with one or more of the following: Watershed plans developed pursuant to chapter 90.82 RCW; the action agenda developed under RCW 90.71.260; regional recovery plans created under RCW 77.85.090; the habitat project lists developed pursuant to RCW 77.85.050; the prioritization process developed under RCW 77.95.160; and priority projects identified for salmon recovery through agency grant programs.(4) Conditions for awarding funding for projects under this program include, but are not limited to:(a) Consistency with the program criteria established under subsection (2) of this section;(b) Tiered incentive rates tied to improving functionality for riparian areas; and(c) Other requirements as determined by the commission.(5) The commission must distribute riparian grant program funding equitably throughout the state, consistent with received grant applications and benefit to salmon habitat. The legislature intends for funding to be primarily for projects located in salmon recovery regions, as defined in RCW 77.85.010, but funding may also be distributed to a project not located in a salmon recovery region upon a determination by the commission that the project will provide a unique benefit to salmon habitat.(6) Allowable expenses to a grantee receiving funds under this section include, but are not limited to, labor, equipment, fencing, mulch, seed, seedling trees, manual weed control, and yearly maintenance costs for up to 10 years.(7) Any native woody trees and shrubs planted with funding provided under this section must be maintained for a minimum of five years or as otherwise set by the commission for each grantee. Vegetation must be chosen to prevent invasive weed populations and ensure survival and successful establishment of plantings.(8) The commission shall determine appropriate recordkeeping and data collection procedures required for program implementation and shall establish a data management system that allows for coordination between the commission and other state agencies. Any data collected or shared under this section may be used only to assess the success of the riparian grant program in improving the functions of critical riparian habitat.(9) The commission shall develop and implement a framework that includes monitoring, adaptive management, and metrics in order to ensure consistency with the requirements of the riparian grant program.

FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCESCarbon Sequestration Forests (40000707)The appropriation in this section is subject to the following conditions and limitations:(1) The appropriation in subsection (2) of this section is provided solely for the department to acquire working forestlands to be managed for increased carbon sequestration and carbon storage through sustainable timber harvests consistent with RCW 79.10.310 and 79.10.320. Pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, it is the intent of the legislature that these lands serve as harvestable replacement lands for structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands designated for conservation and for existing encumbered state forestlands. Once acquired, these replacement lands must be held in the land bank created in RCW 79.19.020. The replacement lands must be purchased before the transfer of any existing forested state trust lands pursuant to this section is fully executed. The department must transfer the appropriated amount into the land bank account in accordance with RCW 79.19.120.(2)(a) If the department acquires replacement lands pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, it must use the replacement lands for the following purposes:(i) To serve as replacement forested state trust lands to replace structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands designated for permanent conservation consistent with the process set forth in subsection (3) of this section in counties located to the west of the crest of the Cascade mountains, which may include, but are not limited to, Clallam, Thurston, Whatcom, Snohomish, Jefferson, and Pierce counties; or(ii) To serve as replacement state forestlands to replace existing encumbered state forestlands in Clallam, Pacific, Skamania, and Wahkiakum counties.(b) If the department acquires land pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, it must allocate the value of any land acquired as follows:(i) Up to $13,400,000 for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section; and(ii) Up to $20,100,000 for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section.(c) The department must designate any lands acquired for the purposes specified in subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section as state forest transfer lands.(3) The department may not designate for conservation any forested state trust lands pursuant to subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section unless the department has received letters of support from the legislative authority of the counties in which the parcel of forestland proposed for conservation is located, and the board of natural resources has approved the boundaries of the parcel proposed for conservation. County concurrence and board approval pursuant to this process must be finalized before any forested state trust lands may be transferred out of trust status pursuant to this section.(4) If the department acquires any replacement lands pursuant to this section, the department must ensure that any replacement of structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands pursuant to subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section be of equal value to the land designated for conservation.(5)(a) In the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the legislative authority of a county seeking to participate in the conservation opportunity described in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section may, for any state forestlands included within the lands designated for conservation, request that the department distribute to the county a portion of the current market value of the parcel as a one-time payment, subject to the requirement that the department must retain no less than $12,000 per acre to invest in replacement trust land. Upon such a request in writing, and subject to prior approval by the board, the department shall distribute to the county the requested portion of the market value as provided in RCW 79.64.110. Any amount distributed to a county as a one-time payment must be deducted from the amount available to purchase replacement trust land for that county.(b) The county treasurer shall distribute any revenues received pursuant to subsection (5)(a) of this section to each appropriate taxing district in which the conserved forested state trust lands are located in the same manner as the revenues would otherwise be distributed if the revenues were received from timber harvest or other revenue-generating activities on such lands.(6) In the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department may designate the structurally complex, carbon-dense forested state trust lands identified in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section as a natural area preserve or a natural resource conservation area notwithstanding the requirements of chapters 79.70 and 79.71 RCW.(7) $6,000,000 of the appropriation is provided solely for the department to prepare commercial thinning timber sales for the purposes of restoring habitat, increasing carbon storage and sequestration, and facilitating access to more timber volume than is possible under normal operating funding.(8) The department may use up to $500,000 of the total appropriation in this section for its administrative costs pursuant to this section.(9) For the purposes of this section, "forested state trust lands" includes both "state forestlands" as defined in RCW 79.02.010 and forested "state lands" as defined in RCW 79.02.010.Appropriation:Natural Climate Solutions AccountâState. . . .$40,000,000Prior Biennia (Expenditures). . . .$0Future Biennia (Projected Costs). . . .$0TOTAL. . . .$40,000,000NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3112.

RCW 43.88.031 requires the disclosure of the estimated debt service costs associated with new capital bond appropriations. The estimated debt service costs for the appropriations contained in this act are $76,105,816 for the 2025-2027 biennium, $425,999,496 for the 2027-2029 biennium, and $655,708,813 for the 2029-2031 biennium.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8002. ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES AND FACILITIES THROUGH FINANCIAL CONTRACTS.(1) The following agencies may enter into financial contracts, paid from any funds of an agency, appropriated or nonappropriated, for the purposes indicated and in not more than the principal amounts indicated, plus financing expenses and required reserves pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW. When securing properties under this section, agencies shall use the most economical financial contract option available, including long-term leases, lease-purchase agreements, lease-development with option to purchase agreements or financial contracts using certificates of participation. Expenditures made by an agency for one of the indicated purposes before the issue date of the authorized financial contract and any certificates of participation therein are intended to be reimbursed from proceeds of the financial contract and any certificates of participation therein to the extent provided in the agency's financing plan approved by the state finance committee.(2) Those noninstructional facilities of higher education institutions authorized in this section to enter into financial contracts are not eligible for state funded maintenance and operations. Instructional space that is available for regularly scheduled classes for academic transfer, basic skills, and workforce training programs may be eligible for state funded maintenance and operations.(3) Western Washington University: Enter into a financing contract for up to $3,000,000 plus financing expenses, required reserves, and capitalized interest pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to construct a parking lot replacement. (4) Community and technical colleges: (a) Enter into a financing contract on behalf of Columbia Basin College for up to $18,000,000 plus financing expenses, required reserves, and capitalized interest pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to construct student housing. (b) Enter into a financing contract on behalf of Edmonds College for up to $9,000,000 plus financing expenses, required reserves, and capitalized interest pursuant to chapter 39.94 RCW to acquire student housing.

(1) To ensure that major construction projects are carried out in accordance with legislative and executive intent, agencies must complete a predesign for state construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000. For purposes of this section, "total anticipated cost" means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project.(2) Appropriations for design may not be expended or encumbered until the office of financial management has reviewed and approved the agency's predesign.(3) The predesign must explore at least three project alternatives. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. The chosen alternative should be the most reasonable and cost-effective solution. The predesign document must include, but not be limited to, program, site, and cost analysis, and an analysis of the life-cycle costs of the alternatives explored, in accordance with the predesign manual adopted by the office of financial management.(4) For projects exceeding the $10,000,000 predesign threshold established in this section, the office of financial management may make an exception to some or all of the predesign requirements in this section. The office of financial management shall report any exception to the fiscal committees of the legislature:(a) A description of the major capital project for which the predesign waiver is made;(b) An explanation of the reason for the waiver; and(c) A rough order of magnitude cost estimate for the project's design and construction.(5) In deliberations related to submitting an exception under this section, the office of financial management shall consider the following factors:(a) Whether there is any determination to be made regarding the site of the project;(b) Whether there is any determination to be made regarding whether the project will involve renovation, new construction, or both;(c) Whether, within six years of submitting the request for funding, the agency has completed, or initiated the construction of, a substantially similar project;(d) Whether there is any anticipated change to the project's program or the services to be delivered at the facility;(e) Whether the requesting agency indicates that the project may not require some or all of the predesign requirements in this section due to a lack of complexity; and(f) Whether any other factors related to project complexity or risk, as determined by the office of financial management, could reduce the need for, or scope of, a predesign.(6) If under this section, some or all predesign requirements are waived, the office of financial management may instead propose a professional project cost estimate instead of a request for predesign funding.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8004. (1) The legislature finds that use of life-cycle cost analysis will aid public entities, architects, engineers, and contractors in making design and construction decisions that positively impact both the initial construction cost and the ongoing operating and maintenance cost of a project. To ensure that the total cost of a project is accounted for and the most reasonable and cost efficient design is used, agencies shall develop life-cycle costs for any construction project over $10,000,000. The life-cycle costs must represent the present value sum of capital costs, installation costs, operating costs, and maintenance costs over the life expectancy of the project. The legislature further finds the most effective approach to the life-cycle cost analysis is to integrate it into the early part of the design process.(2) Agencies must develop a minimum of three project alternatives for use in the life-cycle cost analysis. These alternatives must be both distinctly different and viable solutions to the issue being addressed. Agencies must choose the most reasonable and cost-effective solution, as supported by the life-cycle cost analysis. A brief description of each project alternative and why it was chosen must be included in the life-cycle cost analysis section of the predesign.(3) The office of financial management shall: (a) Make available a life-cycle cost model to be used for analysis; (b) in consultation with the department of enterprise services, provide assistance in using the life-cycle cost model; and (c) update the life-cycle cost model annually including assumptions for inflation rates, discount rates, and energy rates.(4) Agencies shall consider architectural and engineering firms' and general contractors' experience using life-cycle costs, operating costs, and energy efficiency measures when selecting an architectural and engineering firm, or when selecting contractors using alternative contracting methods.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8005. Agencies administering construction projects with a total anticipated cost in excess of $10,000,000 must submit progress reports to the office of financial management and to the fiscal committees of the house of representatives and senate. "Total anticipated cost" means the sum of the anticipated cost of the predesign, design, and construction phases of the project. Reports must be submitted on July 1st and December 31st of each year in a format determined by the office of financial management. After the project is completed, agencies must also submit a closeout report that identifies the total project cost and any unspent appropriations.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8006. (1) Allotments for appropriations in this act shall be provided in accordance with the capital project review requirements adopted by the office of financial management and in compliance with RCW 43.88.110. Projects that will be employing alternative public works construction procedures under chapter 39.10 RCW are subject to the allotment procedures defined in this section and RCW 43.88.110.(2) Each project is defined as proposed in the legislative budget notes or in the governor's budget document.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8007. (1) The office of financial management may authorize a transfer of appropriation authority provided for a capital project that is in excess of the amount required for the completion of such project to another capital project for which the appropriation is insufficient. No such transfer may be used to expand the capacity of any facility beyond that intended in making the appropriation. Such transfers may be effected only between capital appropriations to a specific department, commission, agency, or institution of higher education and only between capital projects that are funded from the same fund or account. No transfers may occur between projects to local government agencies except where the grants are provided within a single omnibus appropriation and where such transfers are specifically authorized by the implementing statutes that govern the grants.(2) The office of financial management may find that an amount is in excess of the amount required for the completion of a project only if: (a) The project as defined in the notes to the budget document is substantially complete and there are funds remaining; or (b) bids have been let on a project and it appears to a substantial certainty that the project as defined in the notes to the budget document can be completed within the biennium for less than the amount appropriated in this act.(3) For the purposes of this section, the intent is that each project be defined as proposed to the legislature in the governor's budget document, unless it clearly appears from the legislative history that the legislature intended to define the scope of a project in a different way.(4) A report of any transfer effected under this section, except emergency projects or any transfer under $250,000, shall be filed with the fiscal committees of the legislature by the office of financial management at least 30 days before the date the transfer is effected. The office of financial management shall report all emergency or smaller transfers within 30 days from the date of transfer.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8008. (1) It is expected that projects be ready to proceed in a timely manner depending on the type or phase of the project or program that is the subject of the appropriation in this act. Except for major projects that customarily may take more than two biennia to complete from predesign to the end of construction, or large infrastructure grant or loan programs supporting projects that often take more than two biennia to complete, the legislature generally does not intend to reappropriate funds more than once, particularly for smaller grant programs, local/community projects, and minor works.(2) Agencies shall expedite the expenditure of reappropriations and appropriations in this act in order to: (a) Rehabilitate infrastructure resources; (b) accelerate environmental rehabilitation and restoration projects for the improvement of the state's natural environment; (c) reduce additional costs associated with acquisition and construction inflationary pressures; and (d) provide additional employment opportunities associated with capital expenditures.(3) To the extent feasible, agencies are directed to accelerate expenditure rates at their current level of permanent employees and shall use contracted design and construction services wherever necessary to meet the goals of this section.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8009. Any building project that receives over $10,000,000 in funding from the capital budget must be built to sustainable standards. "Sustainable building" means a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity, and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. The following design and construction attributes must be integrated into the building project:(1) Employ integrated design principles: Use a collaborative, integrated planning and design process that initiates and maintains an integrated project team in all stages of a project's planning and delivery. Establish performance goals for siting, energy, water, materials, and indoor environmental quality along with other comprehensive design goals and ensures incorporation of these goals throughout the design and life-cycle of the building. Consider all stages of the building's life-cycle, including deconstruction.(2) Commissioning: Employ commissioning practices tailored to the size and complexity of the building and its system components in order to verify performance of building components and systems and help ensure that design requirements are met. This should include an experienced commissioning provider, inclusion of commissioning requirements in construction documents, a commissioning plan, verification of the installation and performance of systems to be commissioned, and a commissioning report.(3) Optimize energy performance: Establish a whole building performance target that takes into account the intended use, occupancy, operations, plug loads, other energy demands, and design to earn the ENERGY STAR targets for new construction and major renovation where applicable. For new construction target low energy use index. For major renovations, target reducing energy use by 50 percent below prerenovation baseline.(4) On-site renewable energy: Implement renewable energy generation projects on agency property for agency use, when life-cycle cost effective.(5) High-efficiency electric equipment: Use only high-efficiency electric equipment for water and space heating needs not met through on-site renewable energy, when life-cycle cost effective.(6) Measurement and verification: For buildings over 50,000 square feet, install building level electricity meters in new major construction and renovation projects to track and continuously optimize performance. Include equivalent meters for natural gas and steam, where natural gas and steam are used. Where appropriate, install dashboards inside buildings to display and incentivize occupants on energy use.(7) Benchmarking: Compare performance data from the first year of operation with the energy design target. Verify that the building performance meets or exceeds the design target. For other building and space types, use an equivalent benchmarking tool.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8010. State agencies, including institutions of higher education, shall allot and report full-time equivalent staff for capital projects in a manner comparable to staff reporting for operating expenditures.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8011. Executive Order No. 21-02, archaeological and cultural resources, was issued effective April 7, 2021. Agencies shall comply with the requirements set forth in this executive order and must consult with the department of archaeology and historic preservation and affected tribes on the potential effects of projects on cultural resources and historic properties proposed in state-funded construction or acquisition projects, including grant or pass-through funding that culminates in construction or land acquisitions. Consultation with the department of archaeology and historic preservation and affected tribes must be initiated early in the project planning process, prior to construction or taking title.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8012. FOR THE ARTS COMMISSIONâART WORK ALLOWANCE.(1) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction of school plant facilities is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 28A.335.210.(2) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction, or any major renovation or remodel work exceeding $200,000 by colleges or universities is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 28B.10.027.(3) One-half of one percent of the moneys appropriated in this act for original construction of any public building by a state agency identified in RCW 43.17.200 is provided solely for the purposes of RCW 43.17.200.(4) At least 75 percent of the moneys spent by the Washington state arts commission during the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium for the purposes of RCW 28A.335.210, 28B.10.027, and 43.17.200 must be expended solely for direct acquisition of works of art; no more than 20 percent may be expended for program administration; and no more than four percent may be expended to conserve or maintain existing pieces in the state art collection.(5) Beginning with new appropriations made in the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, art allocations not expended by the end of the second full fiscal biennium from the issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall lapse, except for art allocations made under K-3 class size reduction grants under section 6313 of this act.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8013. To carry out the provisions of this act, the governor may assign responsibility for predesign, design, construction, and other related activities to any appropriate agency.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8014. If any federal moneys appropriated by this act for capital projects are not received by the state, the department or agency to which the moneys were appropriated may replace the federal moneys with funds available from private or local sources. No replacement may occur under this section without the prior approval of the director of financial management in consultation with the senate ways and means committee and the house of representatives capital budget committee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8015. (1) Unless otherwise stated, for all appropriations under this act that require a match of nonstate money or in-kind contributions, the following requirement, consistent with RCW 43.88.150, shall apply: Expenditures of state money shall be timed so that the state share of project expenditures never exceeds the intended state share of total project costs.(2) Provision of the full amount of required matching funds is not required to permit the expenditure of capital budget appropriations for phased projects if a proportional amount of the required matching funds is provided for each distinct, identifiable phase of the project.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8016. NONTAXABLE AND TAXABLE BOND PROCEEDS.Portions of the appropriation authority granted by this act from the state building construction account, or any other account receiving bond proceeds, may be transferred to the state taxable building construction account as deemed necessary by the state treasurer, on behalf of the state finance committee, to comply with the federal internal revenue service rules and regulations pertaining to the use of nontaxable bond proceeds. Portions of the general obligation bond proceeds authorized by chapter . . ., Laws of 2025 ((H-2081.3/25) state general obligation bonds and related accounts) for deposit into the state taxable building construction account that are in excess of amounts required to comply with the federal internal revenue service rules and regulations shall be deposited into the state building construction account. The state treasurer shall submit written notification to the director of financial management and the legislative evaluation and accountability program committee if it is determined that a shift of appropriation authority between the state building construction account, or any other account receiving bond proceeds, and the state taxable building construction account is necessary, or that a shift of appropriation authority from the state taxable building construction account, or any other account receiving taxable bond proceeds, to the state building construction account may be made.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8017. (1) Minor works project lists are single line appropriations that include multiple projects of a similar nature and that are valued between $25,000 and $1,500,000 each, with the exception of higher education minor works projects that may be valued up to $2,000,000. Funds appropriated in this act for minor works may not be initially allotted until agencies submit project lists to the office of financial management for review and approval.(2) Revisions to the project lists, including the addition of projects and the transfer of funds between projects, are allowed but must be submitted to the office of financial management, the house of representatives capital budget committee, and the senate ways and means committee for review and comment, and must include an explanation of variances from prior approved lists. Any project list revisions must be approved by the office of financial management before funds may be expended from the minor works appropriation.(3)(a) All minor works projects should be completed within two years of the appropriation with the funding provided.(b) Agencies are prohibited from including projects on their minor works lists that are a phase of a larger project, and that if combined over a continuous period of time, would exceed $1,500,000, or $2,000,000 for higher education minor works projects.(c) Minor works appropriations may not be used for the following: Studies, except for technical or engineering reviews or designs that lead directly to and support a project on the same minor works list; planning; design outside the scope of work on a minor works list; movable, temporary, and traditionally funded operating equipment not in compliance with the equipment criteria established by the office of financial management; software not dedicated to control of a specialized system; moving expenses; land or facility acquisition; rolling stock; computers; or to supplement funding for projects with funding shortfalls unless expressly authorized.

School districts and state-tribal education compact schools with enrollments that are less than or equal to ((one thousand))1,000 students are eligible for small school district modernization grants. The advisory committee specified in subsection (4)(a) of this section may recommend amendments to the eligibility threshold as they learn more about the characteristics of school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are unable to modernize their aging school facilities. Districts with incomplete information in the inventory and condition of schools data system are not eligible to apply for construction grants but may apply for planning grants.(3) The office of the superintendent of public instruction must assist eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that are interested in applying for a small school district modernization grant under this section by providing technical assistance and planning grants within appropriations for this purpose. Districts and state-tribal education compact schools seeking planning grants must provide a brief statement of the school condition, its deficiencies, student enrollment, student achievement measures, and financial limitations of the district or state-tribal education compact school. If applications for planning grants exceed funds available, the office of the superintendent of public instruction may prioritize the recipients of planning grants in order to help districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most serious apparent building deficiencies, and the most limited financial capacity.(4) Prioritized construction grants and advisory committee.(a) The superintendent of public instruction must propose a list of prioritized grants to the governor by September 1st of even-numbered years. The superintendent of public instruction must appoint an advisory committee to prioritize applications from small school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. Committee members must have experience in financing, managing, repairing, and improving school facilities in small school districts or state-tribal education compact schools but must not be involved in a small school district modernization program grant request for the biennium under consideration. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must provide administrative and staff support to the (([advisory]))advisory committee. The office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the advisory committee must design a grant application process with specific criteria for prioritizing grant requests.(b) The advisory committee created in (a) of this subsection must evaluate final applications from eligible school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The advisory committee must submit a prioritized list of grants to the superintendent of public instruction. The list must prioritize applications to achieve the greatest improvement of school facilities, in the districts and state-tribal education compact schools with the most limited financial capacity, for projects that are likely to improve student health, safety, and academic performance for the largest number of students for the amount of state grant support. The advisory committee must develop specific criteria to achieve the prioritization. The submitted prioritized list must describe the project, the proposed state funding level, and the estimated total project cost including other funding and in-kind resources. The list must also indicate student achievement measures that will be used to evaluate the benefits of the project. The superintendent of public instruction and the governor may determine the level of funding in their omnibus capital appropriations act requests to support small school district modernization grants, but their funding requests must follow the prioritized list prepared by the advisory committee unless new information determines that a specific project is no longer viable as proposed.(5) Coordination with the school construction assistance program.(a) The full administrative and procedural process of school construction assistance program funding under RCW 28A.525.162 through 28A.525.180 may be streamlined by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in order to coordinate eligible school construction assistance program funding with the small school district modernization grants. Such coordination must ensure that total state funding from both grants does not exceed total project costs minus available local resources.(b) Projects seeking small school district modernization grants must meet the requirements for a school construction assistance program grant except for the following: (i) The estimated cost of the project may be less than ((forty))40 percent of the estimated replacement value of the facility, and (ii) local funding assistance percentage requirements of the school construction assistance program do not apply. However, available district and state-tribal education compact school resources are considered in prioritizing small school district modernization grants.(6) Disbursement of grant funds and reporting requirements. The office of the superintendent of public instruction must award grants to school districts and state-tribal education compact schools. The grant must not be awarded until the district or state-tribal education compact school has identified available local and other resources sufficient to complete the approved project considering the amount of the state grant. The grant must specify reporting requirements from the district or state-tribal education compact school, which must include updating all pertinent information in the inventory and condition of schools data system and submitting a final project report as specified by the office of the superintendent of public instruction in consultation with the school facilities citizen((s [citizen])) advisory panel specified in RCW 28A.525.025.(7) From the effective date of this section through June 30, 2027, school districts receiving a small district modernization grant under this section may not combine this grant funding either with a school construction assistance program grant or with other grants awarded under this section to fund a single project.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8040.

During the 2025-2027 fiscal biennium, the department may remit state funding on a reimbursement basis for 100 percent of eligible project costs. Eligible housing developments are projects that have received public funding and have secured enough funding to complete construction of the project that will result in a certificate of occupancy to open the affordable housing development, including the early learning facility.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8042.
