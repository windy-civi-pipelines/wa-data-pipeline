ï»¿S-0794.1SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5105State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Law & Justice (originally sponsored by Senators Orwall, Christian, Dhingra, Nobles, Salomon, Wellman, and C. Wilson)READ FIRST TIME 01/24/25.AN ACT Relating to sexually explicit depictions of minors; amending RCW 9.68A.050, 9.68A.053, 9.68A.060, 9.68A.070, 9.68A.075, 9.68A.110, and 9.68A.040; reenacting and amending RCW 9.68A.011 and 9A.04.080; adding a new section to chapter 9.68A RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.Sec. 2. RCW 9.68A.011 and 2024 c 88 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.(1) "Digitization" means creating or altering any visual or printed matter to depict ((an identifiable))a minor in a realistic manner utilizing images of another person or computer-generated images, regardless of whether such creation or alteration is accomplished manually or through an automated process.

ï»¿S-0794.1SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5105State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Law & Justice (originally sponsored by Senators Orwall, Christian, Dhingra, Nobles, Salomon, Wellman, and C. Wilson)READ FIRST TIME 01/24/25.AN ACT Relating to sexually explicit depictions of minors; amending RCW 9.68A.050, 9.68A.053, 9.68A.060, 9.68A.070, 9.68A.075, 9.68A.110, and 9.68A.040; reenacting and amending RCW 9.68A.011 and 9A.04.080; adding a new section to chapter 9.68A RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.Sec. 2. RCW 9.68A.011 and 2024 c 88 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.(1) "Digitization" means creating or altering any visual or printed matter to depict ((an identifiable))a minor in a realistic manner utilizing images of another person or computer-generated images, regardless of whether such creation or alteration is accomplished manually or through an automated process.

A "photograph" means anything tangible or intangible produced by photographing.(((7)))(8) "Sexually explicit conduct" means actual or simulated:(a) Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between humans and animals;(b) Penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object;(c) Masturbation;(d) Sadomasochistic abuse;(e) Defecation or urination for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer;(f) Depiction of the genitals or unclothed pubic or rectal areas of any minor, or the unclothed breast of a female minor, for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.
