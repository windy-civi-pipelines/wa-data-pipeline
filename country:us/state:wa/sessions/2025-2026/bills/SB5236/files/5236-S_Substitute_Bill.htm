However, the legislature also finds it prudent not to overlook meaningful opportunities to reduce emissions of other types of greenhouse gases from more niche sources such as anesthetic gases.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds that gases used as an anesthetic in medical, dental, and veterinary contexts, including desflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, halothane, and nitrous oxide, are potent greenhouse gases. Efforts in the medical community are already underway to minimize the emissions from these gases, including by national and international anesthesiologist associations. In other jurisdictions, including Scotland and England, efforts are also underway to phase out the use of the anesthetic gases with the greatest potential greenhouse gas emissions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to reduce emissions from these sources of greenhouse gases, in spite of their obscurity, by:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Studying these gases; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Developing guidance to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases used for anesthetic purposes.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The department of ecology must commission a study to be completed by July 1, 2026, that:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(a) Determines the potential sources of gases with a high global warming potential that are used for anesthetic purposes within Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Determines how these gases are used in Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Estimates the quantity of emissions;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Recommends potential points of regulation for each of these gases; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Recommends measures for reducing or eliminating emissions of these gases.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) By January 1, 2027, the department of ecology, in consultation with the department of health and considering the results of the study commissioned under subsection (1) of this section, must submit recommendations to the appropriate committees of the legislature regarding any further statutory changes needed in order to appropriately and effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of anesthetic gases, including any recommendations to prohibit the manufacture, distribution, sale, or use of specific anesthetic gases. The department of ecology must note, in the report to the legislature under this section, any recommendations that the department of health does not endorse and must provide an opportunity for the department of health to share their opinions on such matters as an appendix to the recommendations.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21A'>43.21A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By April 1, 2027, the department must develop and publish a guidance document intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of gases with a high global warming potential that are used for anesthetic purposes in medical, dental, veterinary, or other similar facilities and settings. Gases subject to the guidance document must include, at minimum: Sevoflurane; desflurane; isoflurane; halothane; and nitrous oxide. In developing the guidance document, the department of ecology must consult with the department of health, and solicit the input from the following:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The state board of health;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The Washington medical commission;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The Washington state board of nursing;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The dental quality assurance commission;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The board of osteopathic medicine and surgery;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The veterinary board of governors;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) The University of Washington and Washington State University;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Associations representing medical, nursing, dental, or veterinary practitioners that use anesthetic gases;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Associations representing facilities at which anesthetic gases are used;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) Environmental organizations with a focus on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) Subject matter experts with knowledge of the most efficient and effective methods to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from anesthetic gas use.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) In developing the guidance document, the department must consider:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The efforts of other jurisdictions, including those in Europe, to restrict the use of high global warming potential greenhouse gases or to otherwise reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of anesthesia;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The guidance documents or best practices prepared by national and international anesthesiology professionals, including the American society of anesthesiologists, the world federation of societies of anaesthesiologists, and the American association of nurse anesthesiology; and guidance documents published in peer-reviewed medical journals;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Existing practices in place at facilities and by practitioners in Washington to limit greenhouse gas emissions associated with anesthesia use;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Input related to professional liability and medical procedure risks associated with the implementation of alternative anesthetic options intended to lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of anesthetic gases; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Any additional financial considerations in the use of changes intended to reduce emissions of anesthetic gases.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The goal of the guidance document must be to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of anesthetic gases, but without limiting the judgment or needs of medical, nursing, dental, or veterinary professionals in providing safe and effective care, while allowing flexibility for extenuating clinical circumstances when, in the opinion of the medical professional, unrestricted use of anesthetic gases is needed for patient safety and comfort. Nothing in the guidance document may be construed to require a facility or practitioner to provide medical care in a manner that increases medical procedure or professional liability risks in the judgment of the facility owner or operator or the medical professional. </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) By January 1, 2028, facilities at which anesthetic gases are used, and the medical, nursing, dental, or veterinary practitioners that use such gases, may only use anesthesia in a manner consistent with the guidance document published under this section. The department may not issue penalties under this section to a facility owner or operator or a practitioner for a failure to follow the guidance document. </div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
