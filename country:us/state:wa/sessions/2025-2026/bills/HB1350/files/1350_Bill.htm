However, for too long, Washington's broken child care system has been upending the lives of working families, kids, and employers. Many Washington families cannot find or afford child care while child care workers earn poverty level wages for their essential work.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that the state made significant progress with the historic fair start for kids act in 2021, which included a baseline subsidized child care reimbursement rate for child care providers at the 85th percentile of the market, and the state has been making numerous other advancements in recent years. The next step in this progress is updating how the state sets child care subsidy rates to more accurately reflect what it costs to provide quality care, based on the cost of living, including living wages for providers, in order to grow this essential workforce using the cost of quality care rate model. This model is a modernized approach to investing in quality care for families and living wages and benefits for providers, and it was cocreated with child care providers including the early educator design team, additional content experts, and the department of children, youth, and families using a methodology that was preapproved by the federal administration for children and families.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature intends to maintain the current baseline reimbursement rate for subsidized child care providers, but also to require that going forward recommendations for provider reimbursement rates are based on a cost of quality child care rate model. By doing so, the legislature intends to take the next step to fortify the child care infrastructure working families and employers need and deserve.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.216.828'>43.216.828</a> and 2021 c 199 s 301 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It is the intent of the legislature to systemically increase child care subsidy rates over time until rates are equal to the full cost of providing high quality child care.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Beginning July 1, 2021, child</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Child</span> care subsidy base rates must achieve<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, at a minimum,</span> the 85th percentile of market for licensed or certified child care providers <span style="text-decoration:underline;">based on the most recent market rate survey</span>.
