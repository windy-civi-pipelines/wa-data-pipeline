To promote educational accessibility and reduce expenses for students, it is the intent of the legislature to exempt required course materials from retail sales and use taxes.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that precedence has been set for this policy as 36 states and Puerto Rico have some form of sales tax exemption for course materials either through a direct exemption, no sales taxes, or through not taxing digital goods.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that nationwide, the price of textbooks increases on average six percent each year, doubling every 11 years, and has increased 1,041 percent between 1977 and 2015. The legislature finds that these increases have direct impacts on student success as 65 percent of college students report not buying a textbook because of cost and 11 percent report skipping meals in order to afford course materials.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature recognizes that students who qualify for Washington's state financial aid programs can use funds to purchase textbooks, required course materials, and other necessary materials for their academic success. The legislature finds that nationwide 5,200,000 undergraduate students spend an average of $1,500,000,000 of financial aid on textbooks each semester. The high costs of these items require the use of a student's state financial aid to pay for these items over housing, basic needs, transportation, and other academic necessities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.08'>82.08</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The tax levied by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.08.020'>82.08.020</a> does not apply to sales of required course materials purchased by a student enrolled at an institution of higher education if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The student presents a valid student identification card or other form of identification indicating that they are a student at an institution of higher education;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The student presents proof of enrollment in the course at the time of purchase; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The purchase is made from a bookstore affiliated with the institution of higher education, an online vendor designated by the institution of higher education, or another retailer that verifies the student's enrollment and course material requirements.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) An institution of higher education must provide students with information about the sales tax exemption in this section and the use tax exemption in section 3 of this act for required course materials by:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Publishing details about the exemption on the institution's official website; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Including either an explanation of the exemption or a link to additional information in course or program syllabi.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) "Institution of higher education" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) "Student" means a person who has registered for classes at an institution of higher education.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) "Required course materials" means any textbooks, supplementary materials, and other instructional content, whether in digital or physical format, that are required or recommended by the instructor or institution of higher education for a course offered for academic credit.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.12'>82.12</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The tax levied by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.12.020'>82.12.020</a> does not apply to the use of required course materials purchased by a student enrolled at an institution of higher education.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The eligibility requirements, conditions, limitations, andÂ definitionsÂ in section 2 of this actÂ apply to this section.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.32.805'>82.32.805</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.32.808'>82.32.808</a> do not apply to this act.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
