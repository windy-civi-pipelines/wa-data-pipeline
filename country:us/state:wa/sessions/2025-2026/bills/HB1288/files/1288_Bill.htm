These risks and impacts will vary by region and can overwhelm the resources and budgets of local governments that must cope with severe climate change-related events. Reducing vulnerability to fire, flood, drought, and other climate change-related events requires statewide investment to increase climate resilience.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that when more of Washington's precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and the diminished snowpack melts earlier in the spring, our rivers and streams will be slower and warmer in the late summer. Therefore, climate change will impact the survival of salmon and impact the irrigation that powers Washington's agricultural economy. These same changes in precipitation will also impact recreation opportunities, like snowmobiling and skiing in the winter and camping, boating, and fishing in the summer. The economies of communities that rely on recreational visitors will be deeply impacted, and the opportunities of our residents to enjoy the scenic and iconic natural beauty of Washington will be diminished.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature intends to use climate commitment act revenue to fund real climate resilience solutions. The legislature will fund solutions that: (1) Prevent wildfires and their impacts on the air we breathe by funding forest health initiatives; (2) protect communities from devastating floods by investments in dams, levees, and restored floodplains; (3) provide adequate water supplies for our agricultural producers and instream flows for salmon by investments in new reservoirs and irrigation efficiency; (4) clean up polluted water and outfalls of polluted stormwater runoff with investment in new water treatment facilities; and (5) create more accessible green space and recreational opportunity through investments in new and expanded parks and trails.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature intends to change course in its investment priorities for the climate commitment act revenue to prevent devastating wildfires, provide clean water, protect the air we breathe, and protect and enhance access to our iconic lands and recreational opportunities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65'>70A.65</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The outdoor recreation and climate adaptation account is created in the state treasury.
