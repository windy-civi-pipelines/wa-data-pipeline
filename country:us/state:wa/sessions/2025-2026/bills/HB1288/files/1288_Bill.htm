ï»¿H-0390.1HOUSE BILL 1288State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Dye, Klicker, and BarkisRead first time 01/14/25.Referred to Committee on Environment & Energy.AN ACT Relating to environmental leadership through outdoor recreation and climate adaptation investments; amending RCW 70A.65.250 and 70A.65.305; reenacting and amending RCW 70A.65.030, 70A.65.040, and 70A.65.230; adding a new section to chapter 70A.65 RCW; creating a new section; and repealing RCW 70A.65.260 and 70A.65.270.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that Washington's changing climate creates increased risk of catastrophic wildfires, drought, severe heat events, and flooding, as well as impacts to agriculture, water supply and water quality, and the health of the forests, watersheds, and wildlife. These risks and impacts will vary by region and can overwhelm the resources and budgets of local governments that must cope with severe climate change-related events. Reducing vulnerability to fire, flood, drought, and other climate change-related events requires statewide investment to increase climate resilience.The legislature finds that when more of Washington's precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and the diminished snowpack melts earlier in the spring, our rivers and streams will be slower and warmer in the late summer. Therefore, climate change will impact the survival of salmon and impact the irrigation that powers Washington's agricultural economy. These same changes in precipitation will also impact recreation opportunities, like snowmobiling and skiing in the winter and camping, boating, and fishing in the summer. The economies of communities that rely on recreational visitors will be deeply impacted, and the opportunities of our residents to enjoy the scenic and iconic natural beauty of Washington will be diminished.The legislature intends to use climate commitment act revenue to fund real climate resilience solutions. The legislature will fund solutions that: (1) Prevent wildfires and their impacts on the air we breathe by funding forest health initiatives; (2) protect communities from devastating floods by investments in dams, levees, and restored floodplains; (3) provide adequate water supplies for our agricultural producers and instream flows for salmon by investments in new reservoirs and irrigation efficiency; (4) clean up polluted water and outfalls of polluted stormwater runoff with investment in new water treatment facilities; and (5) create more accessible green space and recreational opportunity through investments in new and expanded parks and trails.The legislature intends to change course in its investment priorities for the climate commitment act revenue to prevent devastating wildfires, provide clean water, protect the air we breathe, and protect and enhance access to our iconic lands and recreational opportunities.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 70A.65 RCW to read as follows:The outdoor recreation and climate adaptation account is created in the state treasury. The account must receive moneys distributed to the account from the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account are intended to enhance outdoor recreation and to contribute to climate change adaptation by investing in forest health, drought resilience, flood risk mitigation, and Puget Sound recovery and water quality. The criteria of RCW 70A.65.250(1)(b) apply to expenditures from the outdoor recreation and climate adaptation account. Moneys in the account must be used for the following purposes:(1) Forest health investments that contribute to climate change adaptation. Funding under this subsection must be used:(a) To address long-term forest health and the reduction of wildfire dangers;(b) For grants and loans to small forestland owners for activities that increase carbon sequestration;(c) For purposes of the forestry riparian easement program. It is the intent of the legislature that not less than $10,000,000 be expended each biennium for the forestry riparian easement program created in chapter 76.13Â RCW or for riparian easement projects funded under the agricultural conservation easements program established under RCW 89.08.530, or similar riparian enhancement programs;(d) For the purposes of the family forest fish passage program, created pursuant to RCW 76.13.150; or(e) To provide grants under a new grant program that invests in the institutions and infrastructure that make timber and farming towns sustainable and vibrant. The new grant program must be administered by the community economic revitalization board;(2) Drought resilience investments that contribute to climate change adaptation. Funding under this subsection must be transferred to the state drought preparedness account established in RCW 43.83B.430;(3) Flood risk mitigation investments that contribute to climate change adaptation. Funding under this subsection must be used to:(a) Reduce flood damage and improve aquatic species' habitat in the basins most at risk of catastrophic flooding;(b) Fund established flood control authorities to improve floodplains and flood protection infrastructure; or(c) Fund sustainable water supply projects that will secure the agricultural industry against the risks of a changing climate;(4) Puget Sound water quality investments, including assistance to regulated entities for upgrading pollution controls required by state permits;(5) Outdoor recreation enhancement and amenities, including the support and expansion of state and local outdoor recreation programs, activities, and infrastructure funded through the state parks and recreation commission, department of fish and wildlife, department of natural resources, and the recreation and conservation office;(6) Grants to support marinas in compliance with the environment protecting measures in aquatic lands or water quality permits;(7) Grants for the replacement or addition of buoys at locations that appropriately balance environmental protection and the needs of on-water recreation;(8) Grants to improve equitable access to local trails and connectivity of local trails to parks and regional trail networks;(9) Stormwater investments that are helpful to salmon survival;(10) Activities to support efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change affecting Indian tribes, including capital investments in support of the relocation of Indian tribes located in areas at heightened risk due to anticipated sea level rise, flooding, or other disturbances caused by climate change. The legislature intends to dedicate at least $50,000,000 per biennium from the account created in this section for the purposes of this subsection; and(11) Decarbonization of medium and heavy duty vehicles in a technology-neutral way. The legislature intends to dedicate at least $50,000,000 per biennium from the account created in this section for the purposes of this subsection.Sec. 3.

Upon receipt of such a request by an agency or agencies with the authority to allocate funding or administer grant programs from the accounts listed in subsection (1) of this section in support of the proposed project, further action by the agency or agencies on any decision, program, project, or activity that would result in significant physical disturbance of the tribal resource or resources described in this subsection must cease until the consultation has been completed.(4) Upon completion of agency and tribal consultation, an affected federally recognized tribe may request a formal review of the consultation by submitting a request to the governor's office of Indian affairs and notifying the appropriate agencies and the department of archaeology and historic preservation. The state agencies and tribe must meet to initiate discussion within no more than 20 days of the request. This consultation must be offered and conducted separately with each affected federally recognized tribe, unless the tribes agree to conduct a joint consultation with the state.(5) After the state agencies and tribe or tribes have conducted a formal review under subsection (4) of this section, an affected federally recognized tribe or state agency may request that the governor and an elected tribal leader or leaders of a federally recognized tribal government meet to formally consider the recommendations from the parties. If requested, this meeting must occur within 30 days of the request, except that a federally recognized tribe may choose to opt out of the meeting. This timeline may be extended by mutual agreement between the governor and the tribal leaders.(6) After the meeting identified in subsection (5) of this section has occurred, the governor or an elected tribal leader of a federally recognized tribe may call for the state and tribe or tribes to enter into formal mediation, except that a federally recognized tribe may choose to opt out of the mediation. If entered into, the mediation must be conducted as a government-to-government proceeding, with each sovereign government retaining their right to a final decision that meets their separate obligations and interests. Mediators must be jointly selected by the parties to the mediation. An agreement between the governor and a tribal leader or leaders resulting from the mediation is formally recognized and binding on the signatory parties. Absent an agreement, participation in mediation does not preclude any additional steps that any party can initiate, including legal review, to resolve a continuing disagreement.(7) During the proceedings outlined in subsections (4) through (6) of this section, the agency or agencies with the authority to allocate funding or administer grant programs from the accounts listed in subsection (1) of this section in support of the proposed project may not approve or release funding, or make other formal decisions, including permitting, that advance the proposed project except where required by law.(8) By June 30, 2023, the governor's office of Indian affairs, in coordination with the department of archaeology and historic preservation and federally recognized tribes, shall develop a state agency tribal consultation process, including best practices for early, meaningful, and effective consultation, early notification and engagement by applicants with federally recognized tribes as a part of the preapplication process in subsection (2) of this section, and protocols for communication and collaboration with federally recognized tribes. The consultation process developed under this section must be periodically reviewed and updated in coordination with federally recognized tribes. The governor's office of Indian affairs must provide training and other technical assistance to state agencies, as they implement the required consultation. Notwithstanding the governor's office of Indian affairs' ongoing work pursuant to this subsection, the provisions of subsections (1) through (7) and (9) of this section become effective as of June 9, 2022.(9) The requirements of this section apply to local governments that receive funding from the accounts created in RCW 70A.65.250((, 70A.65.260, and 70A.65.270,))and section 2 of this act where that funding is disbursed to project and program applicants.

The legislature finds that Washington's changing climate creates increased risk of catastrophic wildfires, drought, severe heat events, and flooding, as well as impacts to agriculture, water supply and water quality, and the health of the forests, watersheds, and wildlife. These risks and impacts will vary by region and can overwhelm the resources and budgets of local governments that must cope with severe climate change-related events. Reducing vulnerability to fire, flood, drought, and other climate change-related events requires statewide investment to increase climate resilience.The legislature finds that when more of Washington's precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and the diminished snowpack melts earlier in the spring, our rivers and streams will be slower and warmer in the late summer. Therefore, climate change will impact the survival of salmon and impact the irrigation that powers Washington's agricultural economy. These same changes in precipitation will also impact recreation opportunities, like snowmobiling and skiing in the winter and camping, boating, and fishing in the summer. The economies of communities that rely on recreational visitors will be deeply impacted, and the opportunities of our residents to enjoy the scenic and iconic natural beauty of Washington will be diminished.The legislature intends to use climate commitment act revenue to fund real climate resilience solutions. The legislature will fund solutions that: (1) Prevent wildfires and their impacts on the air we breathe by funding forest health initiatives; (2) protect communities from devastating floods by investments in dams, levees, and restored floodplains; (3) provide adequate water supplies for our agricultural producers and instream flows for salmon by investments in new reservoirs and irrigation efficiency; (4) clean up polluted water and outfalls of polluted stormwater runoff with investment in new water treatment facilities; and (5) create more accessible green space and recreational opportunity through investments in new and expanded parks and trails.The legislature intends to change course in its investment priorities for the climate commitment act revenue to prevent devastating wildfires, provide clean water, protect the air we breathe, and protect and enhance access to our iconic lands and recreational opportunities.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 70A.65 RCW to read as follows:The outdoor recreation and climate adaptation account is created in the state treasury. The account must receive moneys distributed to the account from the climate investment account created in RCW 70A.65.250. Moneys in the account may be spent only after appropriation. Expenditures from the account are intended to enhance outdoor recreation and to contribute to climate change adaptation by investing in forest health, drought resilience, flood risk mitigation, and Puget Sound recovery and water quality. The criteria of RCW 70A.65.250(1)(b) apply to expenditures from the outdoor recreation and climate adaptation account. Moneys in the account must be used for the following purposes:(1) Forest health investments that contribute to climate change adaptation. Funding under this subsection must be used:(a) To address long-term forest health and the reduction of wildfire dangers;(b) For grants and loans to small forestland owners for activities that increase carbon sequestration;(c) For purposes of the forestry riparian easement program. It is the intent of the legislature that not less than $10,000,000 be expended each biennium for the forestry riparian easement program created in chapter 76.13Â RCW or for riparian easement projects funded under the agricultural conservation easements program established under RCW 89.08.530, or similar riparian enhancement programs;(d) For the purposes of the family forest fish passage program, created pursuant to RCW 76.13.150; or(e) To provide grants under a new grant program that invests in the institutions and infrastructure that make timber and farming towns sustainable and vibrant.
