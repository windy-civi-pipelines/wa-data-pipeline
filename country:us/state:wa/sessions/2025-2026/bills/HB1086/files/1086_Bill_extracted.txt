The legislature further finds that chop shops are prevalent and flourishing, and Washington state does not currently provide law enforcement adequate tools to stop the illegal destruction of cars that profit criminals. The legislature further finds that automobile insurance rates have increased for everyone due to the criminal activity in the state.Therefore, the legislature intends to implement new provisions to hold criminals accountable and to provide restitution to the victims of these crimes.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 9A.56 RCW to read as follows:(1) Except as provided in subsection (8) of this section, it is unlawful for any person to knowingly own, operate, or conduct a chop shop, or to knowingly aid and abet another person in owning, operating, or conducting a chop shop.(2)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a person who violates this section is guilty of a class B felony punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.(b) A person who commits a second or subsequent violation of this section is guilty of a class A felony punishable according to chapter 9A.20 RCW.(3) A person who is convicted of violating this section, in addition to any other punishment, shall be ordered to make restitution to the lawful owner of the stolen motor vehicle, major component part, or other part, or to the owner's insurer if the owner has already been compensated for the loss by the insurer, for any financial loss sustained as a result of the theft of the motor vehicle or part, any environmental clean-up costs stemming from the illegal activity, and any other related costs as authorized by RCW 9.94A.750. Restitution shall be imposed in addition to any imprisonment or penalty imposed, but not in lieu thereof.(4) The following may be seized and are subject to forfeiture pursuant to RCW 10.105.010:(a) Any stolen motor vehicle found at the site of a chop shop, or any part of a motor vehicle found at the site of a chop shop for which there is probable cause to believe that the part is stolen, even if the lawful owner of the part cannot be identified;(b) Any engine, tool, machine, implement, device, chemical, or substance used or designed for altering, dismantling, reassembling, or in any other way concealing or disguising the identity of a stolen motor vehicle or its parts;(c) A wrecker, car hauler, or other motor vehicle that is being used or has been used to convey or transport a stolen motor vehicle or parts from a stolen motor vehicle; and(d) To the extent authorized by law, any other personal or real property used in furtherance of violating this section.(5) For the purposes of this section, "chop shop" means any business, building, lot, facility, location, or other structure or premise where one or more persons engage in receiving, concealing, destroying, disassembling, dismantling, reassembling, or storing any stolen motor vehicle or motor vehicle part which has been unlawfully obtained in order to alter, counterfeit, deface, destroy, disguise, falsify, forge, obliterate, or remove the identity, including the vehicle identification number or derivative thereof, of such vehicle or vehicle part and to distribute, sell, repurpose, or dispose of such vehicle or vehicle part.(6) For the purposes of this section, "major component part" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 46.80.010.(7) For the purposes of this section, "motor vehicle" includes watercrafts.(8) The provisions of this section do not apply to:(a) A vehicle wrecker licensed pursuant to chapter 46.80 RCW, or a hulk hauler or scrap processor licensed pursuant to chapter 46.79 RCW, who unknowingly in the normal course of business and in good faith processes a stolen motor vehicle or its parts, unless law enforcement proves a pattern of conduct composing many transactions involving stolen vehicles or parts over a period of time where the licensee's business practices were conducive to accepting stolen vehicles and parts; or(b) The lawful owner or any other authorized possessor of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle part that has been recovered by law enforcement authorities after having been stolen.Sec. 3.
