Lacking a thriving local tax base, it is difficult to generate the financial resources to supply the needed matching dollars to compete for federal economic development funds.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that there are thousands of federal funding opportunities available for a wide variety of economic development projects, including broadband, equity, housing, infrastructure, innovation, regional development, skills training, transportation, and workforce development. In fiscal year 2019, the federal government provided state and local governments $750 billion for health care, transportation, income security, education, job training, social services, community development, and environmental protection; while in fiscal year 2023, the grants totaled $1.1 trillion.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that when the state provides matching dollars, it can leverage the state's contribution to attract substantially greater funds and private investment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that increasing state matching dollars will enable local communities to access federal funds which would, in the aggregate, provide benefits across a broad array of community priorities and thereby contribute to the state's economic development objectives.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that the state recognized the value of matching dollars to access federal funds for clean energy, climate, clean technology, and resilience, and that it should expand its efforts to all types of economic development funds available from the federal government by creating scoring criteria to prioritize projects, adopting grant award tiers, and establishing a state account with a pool of matching dollars to be available for local communities to secure matching dollars for applications for federal funds.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.330.260'>43.330.260</a> and 2024 c 223 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department shall make available, within existing resources, an inventory of grant opportunities for state agencies, local governments, and other community organizations engaged in economic development activities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) In developing the inventory of economic development grant opportunities, the department ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">may</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">shall</span>:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Regularly review the federal register for opportunities to apply for grants, research projects, and demonstration projects;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Maintain an inventory of grant opportunities with private foundations and businesses;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Provide a resource guide for applicants for federal grants, including links to federal applications and relevant resources, and contact information for department assistance; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Consult with federal officials, including but not limited to those in the small business administration, the department of labor, the department of commerce, the department of agriculture, the department of ecology, as well as private foundations and businesses, on the prospects for obtaining federal and private funds for economic development purposes in Washington state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The department may also facilitate joint efforts between agencies and between local organizations and state agencies that will increase the likelihood of success in grant seeking and the attraction of major events.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(4) The department shall prepare a template letter to be used by an eligible entity to support its application for federal funds that will promote economic development.
