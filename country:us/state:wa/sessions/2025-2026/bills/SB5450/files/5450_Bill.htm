Those who count on clean water quality for their jobs in fishing or aquaculture, to enjoy their recreational interests, or to pursue their cultural traditions are likely to be especially impacted by sewage spills, and would particularly benefit from a system of timely public notice in the event of a spill. A number of other states have established systems in which public notification of a spill is available in nearly real time on a map posted by a water quality regulator, and in which alerts can be issued to those interested in the event of a spill in a particular geographic area. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to improve the public's ability to know about sewage spills that may impact them by establishing such a system. </span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.48'>90.48</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply to sections 3 through 5 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Combined sewer" means structures which are designed to convey both sanitary and storm sewage, and allow the overflow of such combined sewage, untreated, to the waters of the state during periods of high flows.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Sewage spill" means the intentional or accidental diversion of untreated or undertreated wastes that do not meet permit requirements, from any portion of a sewage treatment plant or collection system, including a combined sewer, in this state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Sewage treatment plant or collection system" means any sewage treatment plant, water pollution control facility, related pumping system, collection system, or other public sewage works.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=90.48'>90.48</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By July 1, 2026, the department must develop and publish a public-facing website that includes, but is not limited to, a mapping interface with geographic information on locations where sewage spills occur that are reported to the department under individual water quality permits for discharges that contain sewage.
