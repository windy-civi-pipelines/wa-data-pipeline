Tribal apprenticeship programs ensure tribal members have equitable access to employment and training opportunities in critical industries, including in the building and construction trades at petroleum refineries and in petrochemical manufacturing. The legislature intends for apprenticeship programs operated by federally recognized tribal governments to have the same rights and responsibilities as other approved programs that supply workers to these critical industries, so long as those programs have completed the federal approval process for apprenticeship programs.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.80.010'>49.80.010</a> and 2019 c 306 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Apprenticeable occupation" means an occupation for which an apprenticeship program has been approved by the Washington state apprenticeship and training council pursuant to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.04'>49.04</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Department" means the department of labor and industries.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "On-site work" does not include ship and rail car support activities;
