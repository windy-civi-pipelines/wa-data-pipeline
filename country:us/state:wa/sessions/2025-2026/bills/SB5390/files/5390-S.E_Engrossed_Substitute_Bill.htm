The legislature also finds that the costs to provide access to these lands has been successfully supported by user-based recreation fees and that the costs of continued support and access has outpaced the revenue generated by fees. The discover pass and day-use permits that are used to gain access to state-owned lands have been in place since 2011, and the cost for the discover pass and permits has not changed since then. However, the costs to maintain recreational access have steadily increased. The original legislation anticipated the potential need to consider adjustment in the cost of both the discover pass and day-use permits. The legislature intends to maintain recreational access for all by updating the cost of the discover pass commensurate with the inflationary costs to carry out state recreational programs.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79A.80.020'>79A.80.020</a> and 2017 c 121 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a discover pass is required for any motor vehicle to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Park at any recreation site or lands; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Operate on any recreation site or lands.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Except as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=79A.80.110'>79A.80.110</a>, the cost of a discover pass is ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty dollars</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">$45</span>.
