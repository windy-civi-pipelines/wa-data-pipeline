Holding steadfast to these principles, the state of Washington has a long history of protecting Washingtonians' right to vote in elections, easing barriers to participation, combating attempts to suppress turnout, and promoting civic engagement. As a result, Washington routinely ranks among the highest states in the nation in voter participation, and it has some of the most accessible voting policies in the nation.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature believes that celebrating election day serves as an important reminder of the crucial role of elections in our society. Further, the legislature believes that celebrating election day encourages participation in the democratic process and instills civic values in Washingtonians.
