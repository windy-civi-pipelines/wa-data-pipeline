The legislature believes that when there is low voter participation in an election, policy outcomes are more favorable to special interests and less reflective of the needs of the broader community. Over the past eight years, Washington has had a dramatic gap between odd-year and even-year voter participation: Participation in local elections in odd-numbered years averages around 40.5 percent, while even-numbered year elections average around 80 percent participation, nearly double that of odd-year elections.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Under current law, local governments generally must conduct elections in odd-numbered years that do not coincide with federal or state elections. The legislature believes that holding local government elections in even-numbered years will increase voter turnout and ensure that a broader cross-section of voters participate in contests for local offices, resulting in local governments that more accurately represent and reflect the desires and needs of their communities. In particular, an increase in voter turnout will ensure that the voices of younger voters, working and low-income families, and people with disabilities are heard. Therefore, to increase voter participation in local elections, the legislature intends to provide local governments the option to conduct local elections in even-numbered years.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.04.330'>29A.04.330</a> and 2015 c 146 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) All city, town, and district general elections shall be held throughout the state of Washington on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November in the odd-numbered years<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, except as provided in subsection (6) of this section</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">This section shall not apply to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Elections for the recall of any elective public officer;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Public utility districts, conservation districts, or district elections at which the ownership of property within those districts is a prerequisite to voting, all of which elections shall be held at the times prescribed in the laws specifically applicable thereto;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Consolidation proposals as provided for in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.315.235'>28A.315.235</a> and nonhigh capital fund aid proposals as provided for in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.540'>28A.540</a> RCW; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Special flood control districts consisting of three or more counties.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The county auditor, as ex officio supervisor of elections, upon request in the form of a resolution of the governing body of a city, town, or district, presented to the auditor prior to the proposed election date, shall call a special election in such city, town, or district, and for the purpose of such special election he or she may combine, unite, or divide precincts.
