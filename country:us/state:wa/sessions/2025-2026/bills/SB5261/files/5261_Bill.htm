Maximum net benefits shall constitute total benefits less costs including opportunities lost.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The quality of the natural environment shall be protected and, where possible, enhanced as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Perennial rivers and streams of the state shall be retained with base flows necessary to provide for preservation of wildlife, fish, scenic, aesthetic and other environmental values, and navigational values. Lakes and ponds shall be retained substantially in their natural condition.

Regardless of the quality of the waters of the state, all wastes and other materials and substances proposed for entry into said waters shall be provided with all known, available, and reasonable methods of treatment prior to entry. Notwithstanding that standards of quality established for the waters of the state would not be violated, wastes and other materials and substances shall not be allowed to enter such waters which will reduce the existing quality thereof, except in those situations where it is clear that overriding considerations of the public interest will be served. Technology-based effluent limitations or standards for discharges for municipal water treatment plants located on the Chehalis, Columbia, Cowlitz, Lewis, or Skagit river shall be adjusted to reflect credit for substances removed from the plant intake water if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The municipality demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water into which the discharge is made; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The municipality demonstrates that no violation of receiving water quality standards or appreciable environmental degradation will result.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The development of multipurpose water storage facilities shall be a high priority for programs of water allocation, planning, management, and efficiency. The department, other state agencies, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span> local governments((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">, and planning units formed under section 107 or 108 of this act</span>)) shall evaluate the potential for the development of new storage projects and the benefits and effects of storage in reducing damage to stream banks and property, increasing the use of land, providing water for municipal, industrial, agricultural, power generation, and other beneficial uses, and improving streamflow regimes for fisheries and other instream uses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Adequate and safe supplies of water shall be preserved and protected in potable condition to satisfy human domestic needs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) Multiple-purpose impoundment structures are to be preferred over single-purpose structures.

In addition to traditional development approaches, improved water use efficiency, conservation, and use of reclaimed water shall be emphasized in the management of the state's water resources and in some cases will be a potential new source of water with which to meet future needs throughout the state. Use of reclaimed water shall be encouraged through state and local planning and programs with incentives for state financial assistance recognizing programs and plans that encourage the use of conservation and reclaimed water use, and state agencies shall continue to review and reduce regulatory barriers and streamline permitting for the use of reclaimed water where appropriate.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) Development of water supply systems, whether publicly or privately owned, which provide water to the public generally in regional areas within the state shall be encouraged.
