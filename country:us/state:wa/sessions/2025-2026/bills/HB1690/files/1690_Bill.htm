Some counties may not have current information on the number and condition of septic systems and well water quality.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Municipal governments have limited financial capacity to accommodate existing and new businesses because of the lack of sewer access and disposal in smaller communities, resulting in a lack of economic development and employment opportunities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Programs within the capital budget are inadequate to meet current and increasing needs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Housing development demand and, specifically, the need for low-income housing are increasing, resulting in tiny house villages and multifamily housing being built in mature neighborhoods with aging water and sewer infrastructure, adding to the cost of such housing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) The addition of human waste to water flowing into lowland lakes is adding to the problems of blue-green algae blooms, noxious weed growth, and poor salmon habitat and potential habitat.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Urban lake degradation has a detrimental impact on the quality of life and economy of nearby communities. One example is when world-class rowing competitions in Vancouver Lake need to be canceled because of algae blooms.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to identify gaps in current information, costs needed to fix existing systems, and recommendations for how to ensure water and sewer infrastructure needs are met to protect environmental resources, public health, and communities across the state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21A'>43.21A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department and the department of health must jointly conduct and produce a continuing and comprehensive assessment of the maintenance and upgrade needs for water and sewer systems throughout the state to prevent pollution, protect public health, and support communities and the economy.
