A new section is added to chapter 69.48 RCW to read as follows:(1) Program operators' drug take-back programs must meet all the requirements of this chapter, rules adopted under this chapter, and any department-approved plan, independent of any other drug take-back programs. Program operators must each successfully implement their drug take-back program each year.(2) For each program operator, the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by a drug take-back program should be roughly equivalent to the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by the other program operators as reported in the respective program operators' most recent annual report required by RCW 69.48.100.(3) For each individual program operator, the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by the drug take-back program should be equal to or greater than the weight of covered drugs collected by that program operator as reported in the program operator's most recent annual report required by RCW 69.48.100.(4) Upon evaluation of a program operator's annual program report required by RCW 69.48.100, the department, in accordance with RCW 43.70.095, may calculate and assess civil fines against the program operator based on the following:(a) If the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program is less than 80 percent of the highest weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by another program operator, as reported on the annual program report for the same year, then the department will determine the civil fine to be assessed by:(i) Calculating the difference in pounds between the program operator and the highest amount collected by a program operator, as reported on the program operator's annual report; and(ii) Then multiply the difference in collection weight, in pounds, by the average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined. The average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined must be determined by reference to the program operators' annual reports.(b) If the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program as reported on the annual program report is less than 90 percent of the collection weight goal established by the program operator in the previous year's annual program report, then the department must determine the civil fine to be assessed by:(i) Calculating the difference in pounds between the program operator's collection weight for the reporting period and the goal collection weight for the reporting period listed in the previous year's annual program report; and(ii) Multiplying the difference in collection weight, in pounds, by the average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined. The average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined must be determined by reference to the program operators' annual reports.(5) For the purposes of this section, "roughly equivalent" means that the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program, as reported in the program's annual program report, is at least 80 percent or more of the heaviest weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by any program operator as reported in that program's annual program report.(6) Any civil fines paid by a program operator under subsection (4) of this section must be considered part of the drug take-back program's overall costs, and be included as an independent expenditure category in the annual report required by RCW 69.48.100(1).Sec. 6.

Expenditures from the account may be used by the department only for administering and enforcing this chapter, except that civil fines and payments made under section 5 of this act that are deposited into this account may also be used by the department to support department programs that:(1) Further the legislative findings in RCW 69.48.010;(2) Prevent opioid and other drug misuse;(3) Identify and treat drug misuse and stimulant use disorder;(4) Ensure and improve the health and wellness of people who use opioids and other drugs;(5) Use data and information to detect opioid misuse or abuse, monitor illness, injury, and death, and evaluate interventions; and(6) Support individuals in recovery.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 5. A new section is added to chapter 69.48 RCW to read as follows:(1) Program operators' drug take-back programs must meet all the requirements of this chapter, rules adopted under this chapter, and any department-approved plan, independent of any other drug take-back programs. Program operators must each successfully implement their drug take-back program each year.(2) For each program operator, the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by a drug take-back program should be roughly equivalent to the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by the other program operators as reported in the respective program operators' most recent annual report required by RCW 69.48.100.(3) For each individual program operator, the weight of covered drugs, in pounds, collected by the drug take-back program should be equal to or greater than the weight of covered drugs collected by that program operator as reported in the program operator's most recent annual report required by RCW 69.48.100.(4) Upon evaluation of a program operator's annual program report required by RCW 69.48.100, the department, in accordance with RCW 43.70.095, may calculate and assess civil fines against the program operator based on the following:(a) If the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program is less than 80 percent of the highest weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by another program operator, as reported on the annual program report for the same year, then the department will determine the civil fine to be assessed by:(i) Calculating the difference in pounds between the program operator and the highest amount collected by a program operator, as reported on the program operator's annual report; and(ii) Then multiply the difference in collection weight, in pounds, by the average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined. The average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined must be determined by reference to the program operators' annual reports.(b) If the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program as reported on the annual program report is less than 90 percent of the collection weight goal established by the program operator in the previous year's annual program report, then the department must determine the civil fine to be assessed by:(i) Calculating the difference in pounds between the program operator's collection weight for the reporting period and the goal collection weight for the reporting period listed in the previous year's annual program report; and(ii) Multiplying the difference in collection weight, in pounds, by the average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined. The average collection cost per pound of all program operators combined must be determined by reference to the program operators' annual reports.(5) For the purposes of this section, "roughly equivalent" means that the weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by a drug take-back program, as reported in the program's annual program report, is at least 80 percent or more of the heaviest weight, in pounds, of covered drugs collected by any program operator as reported in that program's annual program report.(6) Any civil fines paid by a program operator under subsection (4) of this section must be considered part of the drug take-back program's overall costs, and be included as an independent expenditure category in the annual report required by RCW 69.48.100(1).Sec. 6.
