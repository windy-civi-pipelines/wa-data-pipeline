By requiring the liquor and cannabis board, in consultation with the department of commerce when appropriate, to evaluate the cannabis social equity program as provided in this act and submit a report with findings and policy options to the governor and legislature by December 1, 2025, the legislature will have an opportunity in the 2026 legislative session to make any policy changes the legislature deems appropriate. The legislature also intends to extend the cannabis social equity program an additional two years until July 1, 2034, and remove a restriction on the issuance of grants to cannabis licensees who meet the social equity applicant criteria. The evaluation required by this act must include opportunities for public feedback, and the identification of any provisions of law or rule and any economic, market, or practical factors that effectively prevent or hinder the successful opening, operation, and business success of cannabis businesses licensed under the cannabis social equity program. This will provide the legislature with information to ensure policies are in place to support successful and efficient implementation of the program.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.335'>69.50.335</a> and 2023 c 220 s 3 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Beginning December 1, 2020, and until</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Until</span> July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2032</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2034</span>, cannabis retailer licenses, cannabis processor licenses, and cannabis producer licenses that have been subject to forfeiture, revocation, or cancellation by the board, or cannabis retailer licenses that were not previously issued by the board but could have been issued without exceeding the limit on the statewide number of cannabis retailer licenses established before January 1, 2020, by the board, may be issued or reissued to an applicant who meets the cannabis retailer license, cannabis processor license, or cannabis producer license requirements of this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) In accordance with (a) of this subsection, the board may issue or reissue:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Up to 100 cannabis processor licenses immediately; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Beginning January 1, 2025, up to 10 cannabis producer licenses, which must be issued in conjunction with a cannabis processor license.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) In addition to the cannabis retailer licenses and cannabis producer licenses that may be issued under (a) and (b) of this subsection, beginning January 1, 2023, and continuing every three years until July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2032</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2034</span>, the board may, with the approval of the legislature through the passage of a bill, increase the number of cannabis retailer licenses and cannabis producer licenses for the social equity program based on:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The most recent census data available as of January 1, 2023; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The annual population estimates published by the office of financial management.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) In addition to the cannabis retailer licenses that may be issued under (a) of this subsection, beginning January 1, 2024, and until July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2032</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2034</span>, the board may issue up to 52 cannabis retailer licenses for the social equity program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e)(i) At the time of licensure, all licenses issued under the social equity program under this section may be located in any city, town, or county in the state that allows cannabis retail, cannabis production, or cannabis processing business activities, as applicable, at the proposed location, regardless of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) Whether a cannabis retailer license, cannabis producer license, or cannabis processor license was originally allocated to or issued in another city, town, or county; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) The maximum number of retail cannabis licenses established by the board for each county under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.345'>69.50.345</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The board must adopt rules establishing a threshold of the number of licenses created by this section that can be located in each county.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) After a social equity license has been issued under this section for a specific location, the location of the licensed business may not be moved to a city, town, or county different from the city, town, or county for which it was initially licensed.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) In order to be considered for a cannabis retailer license, cannabis processor license, or cannabis producer license under subsection (1) of this section, an applicant must be a social equity applicant and submit required cannabis license materials to the board.
