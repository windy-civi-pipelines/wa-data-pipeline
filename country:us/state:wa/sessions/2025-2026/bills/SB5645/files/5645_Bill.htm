Although the establishment of the developmental disabilities community services account provides a mechanism with which to provide that support, a lack of reliable revenue sources has proven to be a barrier to achieving this goal. As a result, the legislature intends to establish a permanent funding source for this account in order to provide ongoing services and supports to assist individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live as independently as possible in the least restrictive environment.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=83.100.230'>83.100.230</a> and 2021 c 199 s 105 and 2021 c 196 s 3 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(1)</span> The education legacy trust account is created in the state treasury.
