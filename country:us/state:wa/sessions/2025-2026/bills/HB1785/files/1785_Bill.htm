The pay for top executives is often hundreds, even thousands, of times that of the median worker at their companies. One report found that chief executive officer pay has increased 1,085 percent since 1978 while the median worker has seen a rise of only 24 percent in that same time frame. In the Pacific Northwest, the average chief executive officer can make between 200 and 400 times the amount of the chief executive officer's employees. This pay gap contributes to income inequality in the United States and further consolidates the wealth of the top one percent. It is the intent of the legislature to impose a surcharge on corporations with excessive chief executive officer pay and provide funding for state programs that support all Washingtonians.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04'>82.04</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Beginning January 1, 2026, in addition to the taxes imposed under this chapter, a surcharge is imposed on any person with an executive pay ratio of at least 50 to one in the previous calendar year.
