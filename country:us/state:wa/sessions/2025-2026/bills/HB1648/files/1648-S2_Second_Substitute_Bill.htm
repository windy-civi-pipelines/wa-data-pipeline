Many child care facilities closed during the COVID-19 pandemic and providers left the child care field. It became clear during the COVID-19 pandemic how critical child care is to the success of every industry as parents need child care to work.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that because of the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the child care industry, the plans of many child care providers to receive education were put on hold as efforts were focused on addressing the immediate needs of child care providers and families. Additionally, the current market-based funding model results in wages so low that affording college tuition is often impossible for child care providers. The limited availability of college courses in multiple languages and the scarcity of early childhood education college programs further hinders access to required training and certification.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) For those reasons, the legislature intends to delay the requirement for child care providers to meet certification and training qualification conditions. Additionally, to recognize the professionalism and experience of individuals currently in the child care field, the legislature intends to add a work equivalency option as an alternative to certification requirements. This work equivalency alternative should take into account the years of service child care providers have committed to educating children, while allowing for upward mobility within the field. Without this alternative, there is an education cliff that discourages child care professionals to remain in the field.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.216.755'>43.216.755</a> and 2020 c 342 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By July 1, 2021, the department shall implement a noncredit-bearing, community-based training pathway for licensed child care providers to meet professional education requirements associated with child care licensure.
