The state's general fund dollars support investments in K-12 education for over 1,100,000 students, early learning and child care, and postsecondary education, training, and financial aid. It supports the health and well-being of our state's residents through services for individuals with developmental disabilities and long-term care for elderly residents, low-income health care, and behavioral health services for those living with mental illness or substance use disorder. The state's general fund pays for salmon recovery, recreational opportunities on Washington's diverse and treasured public lands, and to prevent and fight wildfires threatening our forests, communities, and neighbors. It funds services for our most vulnerable residents and improving public safety in our communities, large and small. Therefore, the intent of this act is to maintain and preserve essential services for Washingtonians into the future through dedicating revenues from this act to the state's general fund.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further recognizes that Washington's tax system remains one of the most regressive systems in the nation, where middle-income families and those making the least contribute disproportionately more as a percentage of their income than top earners in the state. Washington has taken steps to improve the fairness of our tax system by enacting a capital gains excise tax and by funding the working families' tax credit program; however, Washington's tax system was still ranked the second most regressive in a 2024 distributional analysis of state and local tax systems by the institute on taxation and economic policy in spite of these improvements. More progress is needed for the state to have a fair and balanced tax system that works for all residents.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">An October 2024 report by the congressional budget office found that nationally between 1989 and 2022 the uneven distribution of family wealth increased, with families in the top 10 percent of the distribution holding 60 percent of all wealth and those in the top one percent of the distribution holding 27 percent of all wealth. The legislature further acknowledges that, while many Washington residents pay property tax on their most significant financial asset through their home, our state's tax system does not similarly tax the financial intangible assets of our state's wealthiest residents.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to create the Washington state wealth tax in the form of a one percent property tax on financial intangible assets, such as stocks and bonds, publicly traded options, and futures contracts in excess of $100,000,000. The Washington state wealth tax is estimated to impact only 3,400 of the wealthiest Washington residents and will support preserving and maintaining the essential services provided through the state's general fund while further reducing the regressivity of our state's tax system.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>DEFINITIONS.<span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Artificial person" means a corporation; limited liability company; limited liability partnership, limited partnership, joint venture, or any other kind of partnership; association; business trust or any other trust; estate; association; or any other organization.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Cash and cash equivalents" means currency and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
