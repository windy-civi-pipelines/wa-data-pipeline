The legislature recognizes that major environmental health disparities exist within urban areas and that the architectural design of urban areas plays a critical role in the function and health of the ecosystems they inhabit.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature also finds that the built environment itself can be a cause of various forms of pollution that harm humans and wildlife. These forms of pollution include, but are not limited to, noise pollution, light pollution, water pollution through impervious surfaces that channel untreated stormwater runoff to waterways, and building materials that radiate heat causing an urban heat island effect. While regulation, incentives, investments, and innovations in the energy and transportation sector will begin to address harmful air emissions in urban areas, the state recognizes that additional policy leadership and creativity must be directed to reducing these additional forms of pollution that are a by-product of a densely built urban environment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature further finds that there are significant opportunities for incorporating architectural and landscape design in urban areas and the built environment with myriad environmental and health benefits. These benefits include increased biodiversity, air quality, and harmonization with the natural environment, along with decreased energy use and mitigation of harmful impacts of buildings. Design approaches that promote these benefits include green and sustainable architecture, which focus on reducing negative impacts from buildings, biophilic architecture, which seeks to better connect occupants with nature, and regenerative architecture, which involves buildings capable of breaking down at end-of-life, to a net ecological benefit. These design approaches can be achieved at the landscape and neighborhood scale to also incorporate parks, recreation areas, and walkable amenities with more permeable and natural surfaces that draw communities together.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, the legislature intends to create a center for sustainable urban design to provide leadership, to inspire the public with new possibilities for environmentally sustainable urban spaces, to generate policy solutions, and to identify potential projects that would make measurable improvement in environmental outcomes.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21A'>43.21A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The center for environmentally sustainable urban design is created in the department for the purpose of encouraging the use of architectural and landscape design to promote health and sustainability in built environments within first-class cities and other urban areas.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The duties of the center include, but are not limited to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Advocating for environmentally sustainable urban design;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Coordinating with elected leaders and the private sector to achieve renewed urban spaces that improve public health and environmental outcomes;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Encouraging workforce development for related fields;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Identifying priority projects;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Providing recommendations on potential priority projects to state agencies and local government entities, upon request;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Coordinating a biennial design competition for a designated priority project, with the successful contestant demonstrating the specific health and sustainability benefits achievable in that location through environmentally sustainable urban design;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated, awarding grants on a competitive basis for priority projects that implement environmentally sustainable urban design; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Studying, exploring, developing, and promoting ideas that could inform improvements in design by incorporating the values of reintegrating urban living within the greater ecosystem.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The center shall establish criteria for the selection of successful applicants under subsection (2)(f) and (g) of this section.
