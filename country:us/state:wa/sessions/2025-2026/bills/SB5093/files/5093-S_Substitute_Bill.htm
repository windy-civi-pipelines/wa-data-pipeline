The threat of criminal prosecution of pregnancy outcomes is partly traceable to out-of-date provisions in state law that allow investigations of certain abortions and pregnancy losses. The legislature further finds that removal of these provisions changes neither requirements to report births or deaths, including fetal deaths, or prepare and publish vital statistics under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.58A'>70.58A</a> RCW, nor the ability of coroners to investigate deaths, including fetal deaths, that may have been caused by unlawful or suspicious circumstances, including violence against the pregnant person, provided such investigations are not used to criminalize the pregnant person who experienced the pregnancy loss or had an abortion.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=68.50.010'>68.50.010</a> and 2021 c 127 s 7 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The jurisdiction of bodies of all deceased persons who come to their death suddenly when in apparent good health without medical attendance within the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty-six</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">36</span> hours preceding death; or where the circumstances of death indicate death was caused by unnatural or unlawful means; or where death occurs under suspicious circumstances; or where a coroner's autopsy or postmortem or coroner's inquest is to be held; or where death results from unknown or obscure causes, or where death occurs within one year following an accident; or where the death is caused by any violence whatsoever, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">or where death results from a known or suspected abortion;</span>)) whether self-induced or otherwise; where death apparently results from drowning, hanging, burns, electrocution, gunshot wounds, stabs or cuts, lightning, starvation, radiation, exposure, alcoholism, narcotics or other addictions, tetanus, strangulations, suffocation or smothering; ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">or where death is due to premature birth or still birth;</span>)) or where death is due to a violent contagious disease or suspected contagious disease which may be a public health hazard; or where death results from alleged rape, carnal knowledge or sodomy, where death occurs in a jail or prison; where a body is found dead or is not claimed by relatives or friends, is hereby vested in the county coroner or medical examiner, which bodies may be removed and placed in the morgue under such rules as are adopted by the coroner or medical examiner with the approval of the county commissioners, having jurisdiction, providing therein how the bodies shall be brought to and cared for at the morgue and held for the proper identification where necessary.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.70'>43.70</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Correctional institutions and private detention facilities shall report annually to the department of health on the aggregate number of people who experience miscarriage, stillbirth, or perinatal loss while confined or incarcerated in such facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The department of health shall deliver an annual statewide report to the legislature that details the aggregate number of people who experience miscarriage, stillbirth, or perinatal loss while confined or incarcerated in correctional institutions and private detention facilities.
