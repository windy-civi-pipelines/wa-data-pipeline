If the value of the property or the debt exceeds $20,000, the transfer is not effective unless authorized by the court.(2) A written acknowledgment of delivery, signed by a custodial trustee, is a sufficient receipt and discharge for property transferred to the custodial trustee pursuant to this section.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 6. MULTIPLE BENEFICIARIESâSEPARATE CUSTODIAL TRUSTSâSURVIVORSHIP.(1) Beneficial interests in a custodial trust created for multiple beneficiaries are deemed to be separate custodial trusts of equal undivided interests for each beneficiary. Except in a transfer or declaration for use and benefit of spouses or state registered domestic partners, for whom survivorship is presumed, a right of survivorship does not exist unless the instrument creating the custodial trust specifically provides for survivorship or survivorship is required as to community or marital property.(2) Custodial trust property held under this chapter by the same custodial trustee for the use and benefit of the same beneficiary may be administered as a single custodial trust.(3) A custodial trustee of custodial trust property held for more than one beneficiary shall separately account to each beneficiary pursuant to sections 7 and 15 of this act for the administration of the custodial trust.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 7. GENERAL DUTIES OF CUSTODIAL TRUSTEE.(1) If appropriate, a custodial trustee shall register or record the instrument vesting title to custodial trust property.(2) If the beneficiary is not incapacitated, a custodial trustee shall follow the directions of the beneficiary in the management, control, investment, or retention of the custodial trust property. In the absence of effective contrary direction by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other law restricting investments by fiduciaries. However, a custodial trustee, in the custodial trustee's discretion, may retain any custodial trust property received from the transferor. If a custodial trustee has a special skill or expertise or is named custodial trustee on the basis of representation of a special skill or expertise, the custodial trustee shall use that skill or expertise.(3) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a custodial trustee shall take control of and collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial trust property.(4) A custodial trustee at all times shall keep custodial trust property of which the custodial trustee has control, separate from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial trust property of the beneficiary. Custodial trust property, the title to which is subject to recordation, is so identified if an appropriate instrument so identifying the property is recorded, and custodial trust property subject to registration is so identified if it is registered, or held in an account in the name of the custodial trustee, designated in substance: ". . . . . as custodial trustee for . . . . . (name of beneficiary) under the Washington uniform custodial trust act."(5) A custodial trustee shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial trust property, including information necessary for the preparation of tax returns, and shall make the records and information available at reasonable times to the beneficiary or legal representative of the beneficiary.(6) The exercise of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated beneficiary is not effective to terminate or direct the administration or distribution of a custodial trust.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8.

Expenditures may be made in the manner, when, and to the extent that the custodial trustee determines suitable and proper, without court order and without regard to other support, income, or property of the beneficiary.(3) A custodial trustee may establish checking, savings, or other similar accounts of reasonable amounts under which either the custodial trustee or the beneficiary may withdraw funds from, or draw checks against, the accounts. Funds withdrawn from, or checks written against, the account by the beneficiary are distributions of custodial trust property by the custodial trustee to the beneficiary.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 10. DETERMINATION OF INCAPACITYâEFFECT.(1) The custodial trustee shall administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if: (a) The custodial trust was created under section 5 of this act; (b) the transferor has so directed in the instrument creating the custodial trust; or (c) the custodial trustee has determined that the beneficiary is incapacitated.(2) A custodial trustee may determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated in reliance upon: (a) Previous direction or authority given by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, including direction or authority pursuant to a durable power of attorney; (b) the certificate of the beneficiary's physician; or (c) other persuasive evidence.(3) If a custodial trustee for an incapacitated beneficiary reasonably concludes that the beneficiary's incapacity has ceased, or that circumstances concerning the beneficiary's ability to manage property and business affairs have changed since the creation of a custodial trust directing administration as for an incapacitated beneficiary, the custodial trustee may administer the trust as for a beneficiary who is not incapacitated.(4) On petition of the beneficiary, the custodial trustee, or other person interested in the custodial trust property or the welfare of the beneficiary, the court shall determine whether the beneficiary is incapacitated.(5) Absent determination of incapacity of the beneficiary under subsection (2) or (4) of this section, a custodial trustee who has reason to believe that the beneficiary is incapacitated shall administer the custodial trust in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to an incapacitated beneficiary.(6) Incapacity of a beneficiary does not terminate: (a) The custodial trust; (b) any designation of a successor custodial trustee; (c) rights or powers of the custodial trustee; or (d) any immunities of third persons acting on instructions of the custodial trustee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 11. EXEMPTION OF THIRD PERSON FROM LIABILITY.A third person in good faith and without a court order may act on instructions of, or otherwise deal with, a person purporting to make a transfer as, or purporting to act in the capacity of, a custodial trustee. In the absence of knowledge to the contrary, the third person is not responsible for determining:(1) The validity of the purported custodial trustee's designation;(2) The propriety of, or the authority under this chapter for, any action of the purported custodial trustee;(3) The validity or propriety of an instrument executed or instruction given pursuant to this chapter either by the person purporting to make a transfer or declaration or by the purported custodial trustee; or(4) The propriety of the application of property vested in the purported custodial trustee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 12. LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSON.(1) A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodial trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial trust property, or a tort committed in the course of administering the custodial trust, may be asserted by a third person against the custodial trust property by proceeding against the custodial trustee in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the custodial trustee or the beneficiary is personally liable.(2) A custodial trustee is not personally liable to a third person:(a) On a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity unless the custodial trustee fails to reveal that capacity or to identify the custodial trust in the contract; or(b) For an obligation arising from control of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the custodial trust unless the custodial trustee is personally at fault.(3) A beneficiary is not personally liable to a third person for an obligation arising from beneficial ownership of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of administration of the custodial trust unless the beneficiary is personally in possession of the custodial trust property giving rise to the liability or is personally at fault.(4) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not preclude actions or proceedings to establish liability of the custodial trustee or beneficiary to the extent the person sued is protected as the insured by liability insurance.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 13.

In other cases, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative may designate a substitute custodial trustee.(2) A custodial trustee who has accepted the custodial trust property may resign by: (a) Delivering written notice to a successor custodial trustee, if any, the beneficiary, and, if the beneficiary is incapacitated, the beneficiary's conservator, if any; and (b) transferring or registering, or recording an appropriate instrument relating to, the custodial trust property, in the name of, and delivering the records to, the successor custodial trustee identified under subsection (3) of this section.(3) If a custodial trustee or successor custodial trustee is ineligible, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated, the successor designated under section 2(7) or 3 of this act becomes custodial trustee. If there is no effective provision for a successor, the beneficiary, if not incapacitated, may designate a successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, or fails to act within 90 days after the ineligibility, resignation, death, or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary's conservator becomes successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator fails to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.(4) If a successor custodial trustee is not designated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodial trustee, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, the guardian of the beneficiary, a person interested in the custodial trust property, or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary, may petition the court to designate a successor custodial trustee.(5) A custodial trustee who declines to serve or resigns, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodial trustee, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial trust property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodial trustee.

A registration or other declaration of trust for the sole benefit of the declarant is not a custodial trust under this chapter.(3) Title to custodial trust property is in the custodial trustee and the beneficial interest is in the beneficiary.(4) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, a transferor may not terminate a custodial trust.(5) The beneficiary, if not incapacitated, or the conservator of an incapacitated beneficiary, may terminate a custodial trust by delivering to the custodial trustee a writing signed by the beneficiary or conservator declaring the termination.

Otherwise, to be effective, the designation must be registered with or delivered to the fiduciary, payor, issuer, or obligor of the future right.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4.

If the value of the property or the debt exceeds $20,000, the transfer is not effective unless authorized by the court.(2) A written acknowledgment of delivery, signed by a custodial trustee, is a sufficient receipt and discharge for property transferred to the custodial trustee pursuant to this section.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 6. MULTIPLE BENEFICIARIESâSEPARATE CUSTODIAL TRUSTSâSURVIVORSHIP.(1) Beneficial interests in a custodial trust created for multiple beneficiaries are deemed to be separate custodial trusts of equal undivided interests for each beneficiary. Except in a transfer or declaration for use and benefit of spouses or state registered domestic partners, for whom survivorship is presumed, a right of survivorship does not exist unless the instrument creating the custodial trust specifically provides for survivorship or survivorship is required as to community or marital property.(2) Custodial trust property held under this chapter by the same custodial trustee for the use and benefit of the same beneficiary may be administered as a single custodial trust.(3) A custodial trustee of custodial trust property held for more than one beneficiary shall separately account to each beneficiary pursuant to sections 7 and 15 of this act for the administration of the custodial trust.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 7. GENERAL DUTIES OF CUSTODIAL TRUSTEE.(1) If appropriate, a custodial trustee shall register or record the instrument vesting title to custodial trust property.(2) If the beneficiary is not incapacitated, a custodial trustee shall follow the directions of the beneficiary in the management, control, investment, or retention of the custodial trust property. In the absence of effective contrary direction by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other law restricting investments by fiduciaries. However, a custodial trustee, in the custodial trustee's discretion, may retain any custodial trust property received from the transferor. If a custodial trustee has a special skill or expertise or is named custodial trustee on the basis of representation of a special skill or expertise, the custodial trustee shall use that skill or expertise.(3) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, a custodial trustee shall take control of and collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial trust property.(4) A custodial trustee at all times shall keep custodial trust property of which the custodial trustee has control, separate from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial trust property of the beneficiary. Custodial trust property, the title to which is subject to recordation, is so identified if an appropriate instrument so identifying the property is recorded, and custodial trust property subject to registration is so identified if it is registered, or held in an account in the name of the custodial trustee, designated in substance: ". . . . . as custodial trustee for . . . . . (name of beneficiary) under the Washington uniform custodial trust act."(5) A custodial trustee shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial trust property, including information necessary for the preparation of tax returns, and shall make the records and information available at reasonable times to the beneficiary or legal representative of the beneficiary.(6) The exercise of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated beneficiary is not effective to terminate or direct the administration or distribution of a custodial trust.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 8. GENERAL POWERS OF CUSTODIAL TRUSTEE.(1) A custodial trustee has the powers of a trustee under RCW 11.98.070.(2) This section does not relieve a custodial trustee from liability for a violation of section 7 of this act.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 9. USE OF CUSTODIAL TRUST PROPERTY.(1) A custodial trustee shall pay to the beneficiary or expend for the beneficiary's use and benefit so much or all of the custodial trust property as the beneficiary while not incapacitated may direct from time to time.(2) If the beneficiary is incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall expend so much or all of the custodial trust property as the custodial trustee considers advisable for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and individuals who were supported by the beneficiary when the beneficiary became incapacitated, or who are legally entitled to support by the beneficiary. Expenditures may be made in the manner, when, and to the extent that the custodial trustee determines suitable and proper, without court order and without regard to other support, income, or property of the beneficiary.(3) A custodial trustee may establish checking, savings, or other similar accounts of reasonable amounts under which either the custodial trustee or the beneficiary may withdraw funds from, or draw checks against, the accounts. Funds withdrawn from, or checks written against, the account by the beneficiary are distributions of custodial trust property by the custodial trustee to the beneficiary.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 10. DETERMINATION OF INCAPACITYâEFFECT.(1) The custodial trustee shall administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if: (a) The custodial trust was created under section 5 of this act; (b) the transferor has so directed in the instrument creating the custodial trust; or (c) the custodial trustee has determined that the beneficiary is incapacitated.(2) A custodial trustee may determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated in reliance upon: (a) Previous direction or authority given by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, including direction or authority pursuant to a durable power of attorney; (b) the certificate of the beneficiary's physician; or (c) other persuasive evidence.(3) If a custodial trustee for an incapacitated beneficiary reasonably concludes that the beneficiary's incapacity has ceased, or that circumstances concerning the beneficiary's ability to manage property and business affairs have changed since the creation of a custodial trust directing administration as for an incapacitated beneficiary, the custodial trustee may administer the trust as for a beneficiary who is not incapacitated.(4) On petition of the beneficiary, the custodial trustee, or other person interested in the custodial trust property or the welfare of the beneficiary, the court shall determine whether the beneficiary is incapacitated.(5) Absent determination of incapacity of the beneficiary under subsection (2) or (4) of this section, a custodial trustee who has reason to believe that the beneficiary is incapacitated shall administer the custodial trust in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to an incapacitated beneficiary.(6) Incapacity of a beneficiary does not terminate: (a) The custodial trust; (b) any designation of a successor custodial trustee; (c) rights or powers of the custodial trustee; or (d) any immunities of third persons acting on instructions of the custodial trustee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 11. EXEMPTION OF THIRD PERSON FROM LIABILITY.A third person in good faith and without a court order may act on instructions of, or otherwise deal with, a person purporting to make a transfer as, or purporting to act in the capacity of, a custodial trustee. In the absence of knowledge to the contrary, the third person is not responsible for determining:(1) The validity of the purported custodial trustee's designation;(2) The propriety of, or the authority under this chapter for, any action of the purported custodial trustee;(3) The validity or propriety of an instrument executed or instruction given pursuant to this chapter either by the person purporting to make a transfer or declaration or by the purported custodial trustee; or(4) The propriety of the application of property vested in the purported custodial trustee.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 12. LIABILITY TO THIRD PERSON.(1) A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodial trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial trust property, or a tort committed in the course of administering the custodial trust, may be asserted by a third person against the custodial trust property by proceeding against the custodial trustee in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the custodial trustee or the beneficiary is personally liable.(2) A custodial trustee is not personally liable to a third person:(a) On a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity unless the custodial trustee fails to reveal that capacity or to identify the custodial trust in the contract; or(b) For an obligation arising from control of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the custodial trust unless the custodial trustee is personally at fault.(3) A beneficiary is not personally liable to a third person for an obligation arising from beneficial ownership of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of administration of the custodial trust unless the beneficiary is personally in possession of the custodial trust property giving rise to the liability or is personally at fault.(4) Subsections (2) and (3) of this section do not preclude actions or proceedings to establish liability of the custodial trustee or beneficiary to the extent the person sued is protected as the insured by liability insurance.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 13. DECLINATION, RESIGNATION, INCAPACITY, DEATH, OR REMOVAL OF CUSTODIAL TRUSTEE, DESIGNATION OF SUCCESSOR CUSTODIAL TRUSTEE.(1) Before accepting the custodial trust property, a person designated as custodial trustee may decline to serve by notifying the person who made the designation, the transferor, or the transferor's legal representative. If an event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred, the substitute custodial trustee designated under section 3 of this act becomes the custodial trustee, or, if a substitute custodial trustee has not been designated, the person who made the designation may designate a substitute custodial trustee pursuant to section 3 of this act. In other cases, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative may designate a substitute custodial trustee.(2) A custodial trustee who has accepted the custodial trust property may resign by: (a) Delivering written notice to a successor custodial trustee, if any, the beneficiary, and, if the beneficiary is incapacitated, the beneficiary's conservator, if any; and (b) transferring or registering, or recording an appropriate instrument relating to, the custodial trust property, in the name of, and delivering the records to, the successor custodial trustee identified under subsection (3) of this section.(3) If a custodial trustee or successor custodial trustee is ineligible, resigns, dies, or becomes incapacitated, the successor designated under section 2(7) or 3 of this act becomes custodial trustee. If there is no effective provision for a successor, the beneficiary, if not incapacitated, may designate a successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, or fails to act within 90 days after the ineligibility, resignation, death, or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary's conservator becomes successor custodial trustee. If the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator fails to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.(4) If a successor custodial trustee is not designated pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodial trustee, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, the guardian of the beneficiary, a person interested in the custodial trust property, or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary, may petition the court to designate a successor custodial trustee.(5) A custodial trustee who declines to serve or resigns, or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodial trustee, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial trust property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodial trustee.
