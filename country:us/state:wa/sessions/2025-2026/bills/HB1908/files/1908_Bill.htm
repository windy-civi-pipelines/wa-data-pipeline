Washington state, like much of our country, has a mental and behavioral health care crisis that is causing increased rates of homelessness and substance abuse. Existing resident and respite care RHCs in our state that are both well run and well respected by the individuals, families, and communities they serve are being underutilized. Opening these facilities to new residents will provide immediate and effective relief to dozens of developmentally disabled individuals and their families who have no other viable and cost reasonable options for care.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.20.020'>71A.20.020</a> and 2011 1st sp.s. c 30 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The</span> following residential habilitation centers are permanently established to provide services to persons with developmental disabilities: Lakeland Village, located at Medical Lake, Spokane county; Rainier School, located at Buckley, Pierce county; Yakima Valley School, located at Selah, Yakima county; and Fircrest School, located at Seattle, King county.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(2) The Yakima Valley School, located at Selah, Yakima county, shall cease to operate as a residential habilitation center when the conditions in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.20.180'>71A.20.180</a>(2)(b) are met.</span>))<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.20.180'>71A.20.180</a> (Closure of Yakima Valley School<span style="font-family:times new roman;">â</span>Department duties<span style="font-family:times new roman;">â</span>Continuation of services) and 2017 3rd sp.s. c 19 s 1 &amp; 2011 1st sp.s. c 30 s 6 are each repealed.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
