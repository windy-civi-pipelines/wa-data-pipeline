Skyrocketing unemployment rates have exposed the inequalities of the current private employer-based health care system while causing unsustainable strain to the state's medicaid system. These disparities disproportionately affect already marginalized communities. With the intent to provide stable coverage from time of birth and maintained as a legal guarantee to all residents, the Washington legislature shall create a single unified nonprofit financing entity called the Washington health trust to provide reimbursements for all medical expenditures covered under the program. Multiple economic analyses find that removing means testing in favor of universal eligibility under a single comprehensive coverage package and standardizing reimbursement rates will simplify health financing, eliminate administrative waste, create more equitable outcomes across the state, and guarantee all residents coverage across a comprehensive set of essential health benefits without the burden of premiums, deductibles, copayments, or medical bills regardless of skin color, cultural identity, level of income, or other socioeconomic status.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) All residents of the state of Washington are eligible for coverage through this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Individuals enrolled for essential health benefits under this chapter may obtain health services from any participating institution, agency, or individual qualified to provide the service including participating providers outside the state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Residents may obtain coverage for health care benefits in excess of those available under the trust, including additional benefits that an employer may provide to employees and their dependents and spouses or to former employees and their dependents and spouses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) No person shall, on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, immigration status, or sex, including sex stereotyping, gender identity, sexual orientation, body size, and pregnancy and related medical or preexisting conditions, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination by any participating provider or any entity conducting, administering, or funding a health program or activity, including contracts of insurance, under this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Participating providers may not be denied reimbursement by the Washington health trust for any essential health benefit that is within the scope of their practice, consistent with the accepted standard of care as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.70.040'>7.70.040</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) A participating health care provider is not required to furnish any health care service that is outside the scope of their practice or, in the health care provider's reasonable clinical judgment, not consistent with the accepted standard of care as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.70.040'>7.70.040</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Participating providers may receive payments from sources other than the trust.
