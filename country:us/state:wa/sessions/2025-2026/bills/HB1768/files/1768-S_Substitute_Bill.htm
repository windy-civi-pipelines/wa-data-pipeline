The legislature also finds that it has taken steps to help preserve the availability and affordability of rental lots for manufactured homeowners, who are often senior or low-income households. However, the legislature further finds that acquisition of local manufactured housing communities by large investment and business entities is driving local landlords out of business while displacing homeowners with significant increases in rent and fees. Therefore, the legislature intends to prohibit large investment and business entities from purchasing more of the state's existing manufactured housing communities so that our state's residents and families can afford to buy and live in manufactured homes in existing communities.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1)(a) A business entity may not purchase, acquire, or otherwise obtain an interest in another manufactured housing community or lot if it has an interest in at least:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(i) Five manufactured housing communities; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) 200 manufactured housing lots in one or more manufactured housing communities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) An investment entity may not purchase, acquire, or otherwise obtain an interest in a manufactured housing community or lot.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A business or investment entity is not subject to the prohibitions in subsection (1) of this section if the entity is:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) An eligible organization as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.20.030'>59.20.030</a>; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Acquiring an ownership interest in a manufactured housing community or lot through the development of a new manufactured housing community or lot.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature finds that the practices covered by this section are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.86'>19.86</a> RCW.
