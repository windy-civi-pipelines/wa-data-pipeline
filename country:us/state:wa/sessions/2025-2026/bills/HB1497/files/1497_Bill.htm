The legislature also finds that it has enacted significant policies in recent years that are already showing promise in helping the state to achieve its food waste, wasted food, and organic materials management goals. More work, however, remains to be done in the organic materials management space, including the refinement of policies enacted in recent years to make the envisioned programs more efficient, implementable, comprehensive, and effective. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to take another step forward on the path toward more environmentally and economically sustainable food and organic materials management systems by enacting additional incremental policy changes to this end.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">SOURCE SEPARATION AND CONTAMINATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.207'>70A.207</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department must develop an education and outreach program focused on residential organics source separation participation and contamination reduction.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The education and outreach program must include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) An assessment of barriers and motivators for the source separation of food scraps, which must include researching different terminologies, technologies, and strategies for representative audiences;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Pilot strategies to motivate residents to increase the diversion of organic materials to productive uses while reducing contamination; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A toolkit for counties and cities to voluntarily implement that can be customized for different geographies and audiences.
