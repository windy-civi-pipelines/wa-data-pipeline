The legislature also finds that it has enacted significant policies in recent years that are already showing promise in helping the state to achieve its food waste, wasted food, and organic materials management goals. More work, however, remains to be done in the organic materials management space, including the refinement of policies enacted in recent years to make the envisioned programs more efficient, implementable, comprehensive, and effective. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to take another step forward on the path toward more environmentally and economically sustainable food and organic materials management systems by enacting additional incremental policy changes to this end.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">ORGANICS GRANT PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.207.050'>70A.207.050</a> and 2024 c 341 s 202 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department, through the center, must develop and administer grant programs to support the implementation of the requirements of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">this act, including the requirements of section 3 of this act,</span> chapter 341, Laws of 2024<span style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span> and chapter 180, Laws of 2022, with priority given to grants that support the implementation of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.205.540'>70A.205.540</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.205.545'>70A.205.545</a>.
