These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production. Incentivizing distributed energy can help us protect our rich agricultural lands and meet our clean energy goals.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.21F'>43.21F</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The following categories of clean energy facilities and nonproject activities that reduce environmental impacts are determined to constitute distributed energy priorities:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Solar energy generation and accompanying energy storage and electricity transmission and distribution, including vehicle charging equipment, when such facilities are located:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of electrical transmission facilities;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Within the easement, right-of-way, or existing footprint of a state highway or city or county road;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) On structures over or enclosing irrigation canals, drainage ditches, and irrigation, agricultural, livestock supply, stormwater, or wastewater reservoirs or similar impoundments of state waters that do not host salmon or steelhead trout runs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) On elevated structures over parking lots;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) On lands within a transportation facility, including but not limited to airports and railroad facilities, or restricted from other developments by transportation facility operations;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) On closed or capped portions of landfills;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) On reclaimed or former surface mine lands or contaminated sites that have been remediated under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.305'>70A.305</a> RCW or the federal comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act (42 U.S.C.
