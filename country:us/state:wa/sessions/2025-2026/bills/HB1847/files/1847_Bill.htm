These projects can come with significant challenges. This act aims to incentivize the development of renewable energy on lands and structures that have minimal disruption to natural habitats, communities, cultural resources, and agriculture. This could include small-scale wind energy developments, solar energy developments on landfills, structures, and other developed lands, and the placement of solar panels on agricultural lands that ensure the continued viability of agriculture alongside energy production.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Washington state can lead by example, showing commitment to our own clean energy goals by identifying state lands and buildings appropriate for clean energy projects, ensuring that state resources are leveraged to meet our broader goals.
