Many of these programs are designed to allow students to begin working in the field during or upon completion of the program; however, some state agencies have enacted rules that place age restrictions on when a student can start a program, test for a license or certification, or work in a profession for which they have been issued a certification or license. These restrictions are not required by federal law, are inconsistent with many other states, and are barriers to 16 and 17 year old students being able to continue with more advanced coursework or otherwise work in a profession after completing training and certification or licensure.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Therefore, the legislature intends to direct specified state agencies to revise rules or policies that have been identified as barriers to 16 and 17 year old students being able to continue with more advanced coursework or otherwise work in a profession after completing training and certification or licensure.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.73'>18.73</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The department shall develop a process for authorizing a student who is 16 years of age to begin an emergency medical services training course administered by a state-approved skill center or other bona fide vocational educational program approved by the office of the superintendent of public instruction, provided that the program requires continuous training until the student graduates from high school or turns 18 years of age, whichever is earlier.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.43'>43.43</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The director of fire protection shall assess its policies affecting students who are participating in fire services training offered at: A community and technical college, including through the running start program established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.600.300'>28A.600.300</a>; a preparatory secondary career and technical education program under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.700'>28A.700</a> RCW, including a program administered by a skill center under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.245'>28A.245</a> RCW; and other relevant educational programs.
