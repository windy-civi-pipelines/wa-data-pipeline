ï»¿S-0088.3SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL 8004State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenator HasegawaPrefiled 12/23/24.TO THE HONORABLE DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE AND THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED, AND TO THE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, AND TO THE SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES:We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as follows:WHEREAS, Universal access to affordable health care is one of the most important issues in the United States; andWHEREAS, Our current health care system is in a downward spiral with costs continuing to skyrocket, medical debt driving many into bankruptcy or life-altering indebtedness, increasing child mortality rates especially in communities with lower incomes, and creating unnecessary suffering in entire families who struggle to maintain health care insurance coverage or recover from the impacts of health care costs up to and including bankruptcy and homelessness; andWHEREAS, Article 25 of the universal declaration of human rights ratified by the United Nations declares health care is a human right; andWHEREAS, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhumane"; andWHEREAS, A national universal health care program is the most efficient and cost-effective means of providing access to health care for everyone and eliminating the economic, physical and mental health pain and suffering so many Americans are experiencing due to lack of timely access to health care and/or debt incurred; andWHEREAS, A state-run universal health care program, in the state of Washington, absent current barriers in federal law, could replace the state's current multipayer system in which individuals, private businesses, and government entities pay public and private insurers for health care coverage; andWHEREAS, This health plan would establish a state agency to finance all primary and medically necessary health care with substantial savings compared with the existing multipayer system of public and private insurers; andWHEREAS, This health plan would reduce financial barriers to access care and the growing number of residents with inadequate coverage. By reducing administrative and other waste, including health insurance company profits and excessive prices for drugs, hospitals, and medical devices, it would save money on health care; andWHEREAS, Washington businesses and workers will benefit by lowering the cost of health care, removing the burden of unfunded and inadequate coverage, and allowing businesses to compete more effectively on national and international markets. Businesses will also benefit directly by removing the administrative costs of selecting and implementing health insurance programs for their workers, a billion-dollar expenditure for businesses in Washington state; andWHEREAS, The current system of fragmented private health insurance is the main obstacle to expanding access to health care because it promotes administrative waste, both in the processing of bills by providers and in the administration of a health insurance system with its many separate health insurance companies, each offering a large variety of separate plans, each plan involving separate pricing schemes; andWHEREAS, The large number of independent companies and health plans forces each provider to operate an entire back office with billing clerks and other personnel to deal with billing and negotiating prices for services and vastly inflating the cost for providing health care; andWHEREAS, Because the failures of our health care system most dramatically harm marginalized communities, creating a system of universal access, free point-of-service care and standardized reimbursements will not only make health care less expensive, it will also make it fairer and more equitable. Instead of being a system that destroys future opportunity for many, it will be a system which empowers communities through their newfound health and independence;NOW, THEREFORE, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that the federal government:(1) Create a universal health care program to ensure that every resident of Washington state and our country has timely access to health care services without incurring crippling familial debt;(2) Absent federal government action on the request in subsection (1) of this memorial, partner with the state of Washington to reduce barriers and allow the state to successfully implement a universal health system for the people of Washington such as passing legislation similar to HR 6270 (by Rep. Ro Khanna, CA-17) that was introduced in the 118th Congress which will allow states to create their own universal health care programs; or(3) Absent federal government action on the requests in subsections (1) and (2) of this memorial with the appropriate federal agencies, work to grant Washington state the appropriate waivers to remove the restrictions on the state's ability to create a universal health care system.BE IT RESOLVED, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor, the federal agencies involved with granting the requested necessary waivers, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington.--- END ---
