In order to preserve these critical gains, for the benefit of the state and those individuals awaiting services, the legislature finds that implementing measures to reduce the continued growth of referrals to the competency system are necessary. The state's forensic bed capacity forecast model indicates that if the state continues to receive competency referrals from local superior, district, and municipal courts at the same volume, the state will again fall behind.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that historical investments and policy changes have been made in behavioral health services over the past several years, designed to both increase capacity to provide competency to stand trial services and to reduce the need for them by creating opportunities for diversion, prevention, and improved community health. New construction at western state hospital has resulted in the opening of 58 forensic psychiatric beds in the first quarter of 2023, while emergency community hospital contracts expanded to allow for the discharge or transfer of over 50 civil conversion patients occupying forensic state hospital beds over the same period. Sixteen beds for civil conversion patients opened at Maple Lane school in the first quarter of 2023, with 30 additional beds for patients acquitted by reason of insanity opened in early 2024. The state also acquired a new facility in 2024, now known as Olympic Heritage behavioral health, which added to this historic rise in bed capacity in the state of Washington. Over a longer time period, 350 forensic beds are planned to open within a new forensic hospital on the western state hospital campus between 2028 and 2029. Policy and budget changes have increased capacity for assisted outpatient treatment, 988 crisis response, use of medication for opioid use disorders in jails and community settings, reentry services, and mental health advance directives, and created new behavioral health facility types, supportive housing, and supportive employment services. Forensic navigator services, outpatient competency restoration programs, clinical intervention specialists and other specialty forensic services are now available and continuing to be deployed in phase one, two, and three Trueblood settlement regions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that these investments over a period of many years have made significant improvements in the wait times for competency services. Even so, there remains a need for everyone to come together to find solutions to both reduce demand for forensic services and shrink the number of individuals whose only access to behavioral health care is through the criminal justice system. Forensic services should be reserved only for those where the state's interest is sufficient to justify the detention and greater efforts are needed to prevent or divert individuals with behavioral health needs from being unnecessarily incarcerated. The state needs collaboration from local governments and other entities to provide and develop services and supports to patients connected to the forensic system, to reduce the flow of competency referrals coming from municipal, district, and superior courts, and to improve availability and effectiveness of behavioral health services provided outside the criminal justice system.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.77.074'>10.77.074</a> and 2023 c 453 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Subject to the limitations described in subsection (2) of this section, a court may appoint an impartial forensic navigator employed by or contracted by the department to assist individuals who have been referred for competency evaluation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for class B and class C felonies and all misdemeanors</span> and shall appoint a forensic navigator in circumstances described under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.77.072'>10.77.072</a>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Class A felonies will not be referred to forensic navigators unless requested by a party to the proceedings or the court.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A forensic navigator must assist the individual to access services related to diversion and community outpatient competency restoration.
