The advanced clean cars and advanced clean cars II components of the zero-emission vehicle program require manufacturers of passenger cars and light duty trucks to achieve an escalating minimum percentage of zero-emission vehicles for sale or lease in Washington, or to obtain surplus credits from an auto manufacturer that has exceeded this minimum compliance obligation. By providing for the creation of these tradeable and bankable credits, the program creates an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to maximize their investments in developing and selling cleaner cars. The legislature also finds that the creation of these tradeable and bankable credits creates the opportunity for a financial windfall accruing to firms that are not burdened by the legacy production of internal combustion engine vehicles that make a compliance obligation more difficult under the program. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to address this unintended outcome by taxing the windfall profits from the generation of surplus zero-emission vehicle credits and reinvesting those funds in other programs and incentives that promote cleaner vehicles that further state climate goals.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Banked" means a ZEV credit that a manufacturer has carried over for use in future model years in which a manufacturer has a shortfall or for use to offset a manufacturer's deficit carried over from a previous model year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Manufacturer" has the same meaning as in WAC 173-423-040, as it existed as of January 1, 2025.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Model year" has the same meaning as in WAC 173-423-040, as it existed as of January 1, 2025.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Pooled" means a ZEV credit that has been earned in Washington and transferred to another state that implements a program for zero-emission vehicles that is consistent with California motor vehicle emissions standards and 42 U.S.C.
