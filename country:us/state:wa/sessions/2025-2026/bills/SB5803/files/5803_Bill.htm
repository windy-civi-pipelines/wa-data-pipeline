It remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans each year, including 8,300 Washingtonians. Of cancer deaths in Washington, 27 percent are attributable to smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The growing market for flavored tobacco and nicotine products is undermining the nation's progress in reducing overall youth tobacco use. Flavored tobacco and nicotine products, including menthol cigarettes, have been shown to be starter products for youth who begin using tobacco, establishing tobacco habits that can lead to long-term addiction. Of youth who have ever used a tobacco product, eight out of 10 initiated with a flavored product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The United States surgeon general declared youth vapor product use an "epidemic" in 2018. More than 1,600,000 middle and high school students across the United States currently use vapor products, including almost eight percent of 10th graders and 14 percent of 12th graders in Washington. Of high school students who vape, 42 percent are addicted enough to use frequently or daily.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Youth vape because they come in appealing, kid-friendly flavors like cotton candy, gummy bear, and pink lemonade. About 88 percent of youth who vape use a flavored product.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The tobacco industry continues to redesign products to become even more appealing to youth, with some of the newest products featuring light-up video games like pac-man and tetris.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Vaping is not harmless. Youth vapor product use is associated with an increased risk for cigarette smoking, and according to the surgeon general, nicotine can harm the parts of the adolescent brain responsible for attention, learning, mood, and impulse control, and can prime the brain for addiction to other drugs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Like vapor products, cigars are also sold in hundreds of flavors, including tropical twist, chocolate brownie, and cherry dynamite, which mask the harsh taste of tobacco. Black and Hispanic youth smoke cigars at higher rates than white youth. Regular cigar use can cause cancer of the oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, and lung, and it kills approximately 9,000 Americans each year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Each year, more than 9,100 kids in Washington try their first cigarette, with half initiating with menthol cigarettes. Menthol appeals to youth who are initiating tobacco use because it cools and numbs the throat and reduces irritation. The food and drug administration has concluded that menthol cigarettes lead to increased smoking initiation among youth and young adults, greater addiction, and decreased success in quitting smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The centers for disease control and prevention estimates that prohibiting menthol cigarettes in Washington state would lead to 7,400 adults to quit smoking.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) The tobacco industry has targeted African American communities for decades with marketing for menthol cigarettes through sponsorship of community and music events, targeted magazine advertising, and retail promotions. The result today is that 85 percent of Black smokers and 50 percent of Hispanic smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, compared to 29 percent of white smokers. Each year approximately 45,000 African Americans die from a smoking-caused illness. Ending the sale of flavored tobacco and nicotine products will improve the health and save lives of groups who historically have been targeted by the tobacco industry and disproportionately burdened by tobacco-related disease.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) The number of youth using nicotine pouches has more than doubled since 2021, with nearly 500,000 youth reporting current nicotine pouch use in 2024.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) Hookah smoking is linked to many of the same adverse health effects as cigarette smoking, such as heart disease and lung, bladder, and oral cancers. Hookah is available in more than 1,800 varieties, including kid-friendly flavors like bubble gum, cola, and watermelon, and 84 percent of youth hookah users use flavored hookah.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) According to the surgeon general, raising prices on tobacco products is one of the most effective tobacco control interventions. Every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes reduces consumption by about four percent among adults and seven percent among youth. Significant increases in tobacco excise taxes also prevent potential users from starting.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature therefore intends to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco and nicotine products and entertainment vapor products and increase the tax on all tobacco products to reduce youth usage and protect the next generation from a lifetime of addiction and premature death.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.28.080'>26.28.080</a> and 2019 c 15 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A person who sells or gives, or permits to be sold or given, to any person under the age of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-one</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">21</span> years any cigar, cigarette, cigarette paper or wrapper, tobacco in any form, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">alternative nicotine product,</span> or a vapor product is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) It is not a defense to a prosecution for a violation of this section that the person acted, or was believed by the defendant to act, as agent or representative of another.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) For the purposes of this section((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">, "vapor</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">:</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a) "Alternative nicotine product" has the same meaning as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.26.010'>82.26.010</a>;
