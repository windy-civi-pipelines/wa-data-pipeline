A health carrier does not provide meaningful benefits under this subsection unless it provides benefits for a core treatment for that condition or disorder in each classification in which the health carrier provides benefits for a core treatment for one or more medical conditions or surgical procedures. If there is no core treatment for a covered mental health condition or substance use disorder with respect to a classification, the health carrier is not required to provide benefits for a core treatment for such condition or disorder in that classification, but shall provide benefits for such condition or disorder in every classification in which medical or surgical benefits are provided.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) The provisions of 89 Fed.

The independent review organization must forward any additional information submitted by an enrollee to the plan or carrier within one business day of receipt by the independent review organization.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The medical reviewers from a certified independent review organization will make determinations regarding the medical necessity or appropriateness of, and the application of health plan coverage provisions to, health care services for an enrollee. The medical reviewers' determinations must be based upon their expert medical judgment, after consideration of relevant medical, scientific, and cost-effectiveness evidence, and medical standards of practice in the state of Washington. Except as provided in this subsection, the certified independent review organization must ensure that determinations are consistent with the scope of covered benefits as outlined in the medical coverage agreement. Medical reviewers may override the health plan's medical necessity or appropriateness standards if the standards are determined upon review to be unreasonable or inconsistent with sound, evidence-based medical practice. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">For reviews of mental health and substance use disorder services, as defined in section 2 of this act, the medical reviewers must conduct reviews and make determinations in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 2 of this act.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Once a request for an independent review determination has been made, the independent review organization must proceed to a final determination, unless requested otherwise by both the carrier and the enrollee or the enrollee's representative.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) An enrollee or carrier may request an expedited external review if the adverse benefit determination or internal adverse benefit determination concerns an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for which the claimant received emergency services but has not been discharged from a facility; or involves a medical condition for which the standard external review time frame would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the enrollee or jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function. The independent review organization must make its decision to uphold or reverse the adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse benefit determination and notify the enrollee and the carrier or health plan of the determination as expeditiously as possible but within not more than seventy-two hours after the receipt of the request for expedited external review. If the notice is not in writing, the independent review organization must provide written confirmation of the decision within forty-eight hours after the date of the notice of the decision.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) For claims involving experimental or investigational treatments, the independent review organization must ensure that adequate clinical and scientific experience and protocols are taken into account as part of the external review process.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) Carriers must timely implement the certified independent review organization's determination, and must pay the certified independent review organization's charges.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) When an enrollee requests independent review of a dispute under this section, and the dispute involves a carrier's decision to modify, reduce, or terminate an otherwise covered health service that an enrollee is receiving at the time the request for review is submitted and the carrier's decision is based upon a finding that the health service, or level of health service, is no longer medically necessary or appropriate, the carrier must continue to provide the health service if requested by the enrollee until a determination is made under this section. If the determination affirms the carrier's decision, the enrollee may be responsible for the cost of the continued health service.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) Each certified independent review organization must maintain written records and make them available upon request to the commissioner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) A certified independent review organization may notify the office of the insurance commissioner if, based upon its review of disputes under this section, it finds a pattern of substandard or egregious conduct by a carrier.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12)(a) The commissioner shall adopt rules to implement this section after considering relevant standards adopted by national managed care accreditation organizations and the national association of insurance commissioners.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) This section is not intended to supplant any existing authority of the office of the insurance commissioner under this title to oversee and enforce carrier compliance with applicable statutes and rules.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 7.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.43.600'>48.43.600</a> and 2005 c 278 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Except in the case of fraud, or as provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a carrier may not: (a) Request a refund from a health care provider of a payment previously made to satisfy a claim unless it does so in writing to the provider within twenty-four months after the date that the payment was made <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or, in the case of mental health and substance use disorder services as defined in section 2 of this act, within six months after the date the payment was made</span>; or (b) request that a contested refund be paid any sooner than six months after receipt of the request.
