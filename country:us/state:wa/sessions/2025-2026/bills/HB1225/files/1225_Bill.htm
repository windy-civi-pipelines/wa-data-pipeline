While caseloads for essential programs have fallen and revenue collections have reached record levels, the pernicious trend of vastly growing budgets focused on nonessential luxury spending has led to one of the largest budget deficits in state history.<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->These exponential increases in state budgets have come with little benefit to the citizens of Washington state. Over the past decade, Washington state has experienced declining student test scores, fewer students attending postsecondary education, significant spikes in the number of unsheltered homeless individuals in our communities, stagnant carbon emissions, skyrocketing violent crime rates, a worsening housing shortage, severe increases in the cost of housing, steep drops in business climate, and has become one of the least affordable states for working families in the nation. Despite the multitude of promises made about increased state spending to fix these crises, this legislature has unequivocally failed to deliver on these commitments.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to reform the state budgeting process to require accountability for every taxpayer dollar spent, ensure that lawmakers prioritize spending on essential services prior to luxury spending items or tax increases, and place limitations on state spending to ensure fiscal discipline and responsibility.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.88.030'>43.88.030</a> and 2023 c 474 s 8035 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The director of financial management shall provide all agencies with a complete set of instructions for submitting biennial budget requests to the director at least three months before agency budget documents are due into the office of financial management.
