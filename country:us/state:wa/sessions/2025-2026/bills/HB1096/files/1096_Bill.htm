The legislature further finds that administrative lot splitting can provide current owners the opportunity to maintain homeownership in changing life circumstances while facilitating development of middle housing to provide homebuyers, including first-time homebuyers, with more affordable ownership opportunities.  The legislature also finds that lot splitting can be combined with the review of a residential building permit application to create a single integrated process benefiting both homeowners and cities.  Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ease restrictions on, and expand opportunities for, lot splitting in certain cities planning under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A'>36.70A</a> RCW, the growth management act.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=58.17'>58.17</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Cities required to comply with the minimum density requirements under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.635'>36.70A.635</a> shall include in their short plat regulations a process through which an applicant can seek simultaneous review and approval of an administrative lot split and residential building permit to create new middle housing, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.030'>36.70A.030</a>, or single-family housing. The application process may require only an administrative decision, through which the application is reviewed, approved, or denied by the planning director or the planning director's designee based on applicable development standards without a predecision public hearing. A new buildable residential lot and residential building permit must be administratively approved and is not subject to appeal if the following conditions are met:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) No more than one new lot is created through an administrative lot split;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Both the parent lot and the new lot meet the applicable minimum lot size allowed under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.635'>36.70A.635</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The parent lot was not created through the splitting of a single-family residential lot authorized by this section;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The parent lot is not located in a zone that primarily allows nonresidential uses, such as business, commercial, retail, or industrial;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The lot split would not require demolition or alteration of any existing housing that is rent restricted, is rent subsidized, or has been occupied by a tenant paying market-rate rent within the preceding 12 months;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The applicable sewer and water purveyors have issued certificates of availability to serve the newly created lot and dwelling unit; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Access rights are granted or conveyed as necessary on or before recording of the lot split survey to provide access for the maximum number of dwelling units that would be developed on the newly created lot, provided such access rights may be reduced consistent with a city's adopted codes, regulations, or design standards as applicable through review of a subsequent application for a building permit, short subdivision, unit lot subdivision, subdivision application, or short subdivision if less than the maximum number of dwelling units are built on the newly created lot.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A proposed lot split may be conditioned upon dedication of right-of-way on the parent lot to the extent such dedication is required under applicable codes, regulations, and design standards for the development, short plat, or subdivision of the parent lot absent an administrative lot split.
