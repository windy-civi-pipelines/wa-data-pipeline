The legislature further finds that administrative lot splitting can provide current owners the opportunity to maintain homeownership in changing life circumstances while facilitating development of middle housing to provide homebuyers, including first-time homebuyers, with more affordable ownership opportunities. The legislature also finds that lot splitting can be combined with the review of a residential building permit application to create a single integrated process benefiting both homeowners and cities. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to ease restrictions on, and expand opportunities for, lot splitting in certain cities planning under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A'>36.70A</a> RCW, the growth management act.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=58.17'>58.17</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Cities required to comply with the minimum density requirements under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.635'>36.70A.635</a> shall include in their development or subdivision regulations a process through which an applicant can seek simultaneous review and approval of an administrative lot split and residential building permit to create new middle housing, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.030'>36.70A.030</a>, or single-family housing. The application process for a residential lot to be split may require only an administrative decision, through which the application is reviewed, approved, or denied by the planning director or other designee based on applicable development standards without a predecision public hearing.
