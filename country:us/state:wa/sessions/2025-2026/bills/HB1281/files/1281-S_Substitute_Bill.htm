Between 1998 and the present day, there have been multiple legislative attempts to clarify what is meant by the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> and to ensure qualifying patients have a safe, consistent, and adequate source of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> for their medical needs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that qualifying patients are people with serious medical conditions and have been responsible for finding their own source of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> for their own personal medical use. Either by growing it themselves, designating someone to grow for them, or participating in collective gardens, patients have developed methods of access in spite of continued federal opposition to the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>. In a time when access itself was an issue and no safe, consistent source of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> was available, this unregulated system was permitted by the state to ensure some, albeit limited, access to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> for medical use. Also permitted were personal possession limits of fifteen plants and twenty-four ounces of useable ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>, which was deemed to be the amount of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> needed for a sixty-day supply. In a time when supply was not consistent, this amount of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> was necessary to ensure patients would be able to address their immediate medical needs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that while possession amounts are provided in statute, these do not amount to protection from arrest and prosecution for patients. In fact, patients in compliance with state law are not provided arrest protection. They may be arrested and their only remedy is to assert an affirmative defense at trial that they are in compliance with the law and have a medical need. Too many patients using ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> for medical purposes today do not know this; many falsely believe they cannot be arrested so long as their health care provider has authorized them for the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that in 2012 voters passed Initiative Measure No. 502 which permitted the recreational use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>. For the first time in our nation's history, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> would be regulated, taxed, and sold for recreational consumption. Initiative Measure No. 502 provides for strict regulation on the production, processing, and distribution of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>. Under Initiative Measure No. 502, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> is trackable from seed to sale and may only be sold or grown under license. ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Marijuana [Cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cannabis</span> must be tested for impurities and purchasers of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> must be informed of the THC level in the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>. Since its passage, two hundred fifty producer/processor licenses and sixty-three retail licenses have been issued, covering the majority of the state. With the current product canopy exceeding 2.9 million square feet, and retailers in place, the state now has a system of safe, consistent, and adequate access to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>; the marketplace is not the same marketplace envisioned by the voters in 1998. While medical needs remain, the state is in the untenable position of having a recreational product that is tested and subject to production standards that ensure safe access for recreational users.Â No such standards exist for medical users and, consequently, the very people originally meant to be helped through the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> do not know if their product has been tested for molds, do not know where their ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> has been grown, have no certainty in the level of THC or CBD in their products, and have no assurances that their products have been handled through quality assurance measures. It is not the public policy of the state to allow qualifying patients to only have access to products that may be endangering their health.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature, therefore, intends to adopt a comprehensive act that uses the regulations in place for the recreational market to provide regulation for the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>. It intends to ensure that patients retain their ability to grow their own ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> for their own medical use and it intends to ensure that patients have the ability to possess more ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>-infused products, useable ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>, and ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> concentrates than what is available to a nonmedical user.

The legislature further finds that it is crucial that the state continues to ensure a safe, highly regulated system in Washington that protects valuable state revenues while continuing efforts towards disbanding the unregulated ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> markets. The legislature further finds that ongoing evaluation on the impact of meaningful ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> tax reform for the purpose of stabilizing revenues is crucial to the overall effort of protecting the citizens and resources of this state. The legislature further finds that a partnership with local jurisdictions in this effort is imperative to the success of the legislature's policy objective. The legislature further finds that sharing revenues to promote a successful partnership in achieving the legislature's intent should be transparent and hold local jurisdictions accountable for their use of state shared revenues. Therefore, the legislature intends to reform the current tax structure for the regulated legal ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> system to create price parity with the large medical and illicit markets with the specific objective of increasing the market share of the legal and highly regulated ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> market.

The legislature further finds that while recognizing the difference between recreational and medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>, it is also imperative to distinguish that the authorization for medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> is different from a valid prescription provided by a doctor to a patient. The legislature further finds the authorization for medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span> is unlike over-the-counter medications that require no oversight by a health care professional. The legislature further finds that due to the unique characterization of authorizations for the medical use of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">marijuana [cannabis]</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cannabis</span>, the policy of providing a tax preference benefit for patients using an authorization should in no way be construed as precedent for changes in the treatment of prescription medications or over-the-counter medications.

The legislature also finds that family members, especially children, and communities of those who have been arrested or incarcerated due to drug laws, suffer from emotional, psychological, and financial harms as a result of such arrests and incarceration. The legislature further finds that individuals in disproportionately impacted areas suffered the harms of enforcement of cannabis-related laws.

The social equity program should offer, among other things, financial and technical assistance and license application benefits to individuals most directly and adversely impacted by the enforcement of cannabis-related laws who are interested in starting cannabis business enterprises.

A chronic serious health condition is one which:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(I) Requires periodic visits, defined as at least twice a year, for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse under direct supervision of a health care provider;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(II) Continues over an extended period of time, including recurring episodes of a single underlying condition; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(III) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of incapacity, including asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(D) A period of incapacity which is permanent or long term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective.

The first, or only, in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days of the first day of incapacity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of continuing treatment is necessary within the thirty-day period shall be determined by the health care provider.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The term extenuating circumstances in (a)(ii)(A)(I) of this subsection means circumstances beyond the employee's control that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as planned by the health care provider. Whether a given set of circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed within the thirty-day period, but the health care provider does not have any available appointments during that time period.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Treatment for purposes of (a) of this subsection includes, but is not limited to, examinations to determine if a serious health condition exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or dental examinations. Under (a)(ii)(A)(II) of this subsection, a regimen of continuing treatment includes, but is not limited to, a course of prescription medication, such as an antibiotic, or therapy requiring special equipment to resolve or alleviate the health condition, such as oxygen. A regimen of continuing treatment that includes taking over-the-counter medications, such as aspirin, antihistamines, or salves, or bed rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of this title.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are administered, such as most treatments for acne or plastic surgery, are not serious health conditions unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop. Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraines, routine dental or orthodontia problems, and periodontal disease are examples of conditions that are not serious health conditions and do not qualify for leave under this title. Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions provided all the other conditions of this section are met. Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions of this section are met.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g)(i) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if the conditions of this section are met. However, leave may only be taken for treatment for substance abuse by a health care provider or by a licensed substance abuse treatment provider. Absence because of the employee's use of the substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for leave under this title.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an employer from taking employment action against an employee. The employer may not take action against the employee because the employee has exercised his or her right to take medical leave for treatment. However, if the employer has an established policy, applied in a nondiscriminatory manner that has been communicated to all employees, that provides under certain circumstances an employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the employee is presently taking medical leave. An employee may also take family leave to care for a covered family member who is receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employer may not take action against an employee who is providing care for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance abuse.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Absences attributable to incapacity under (a)(ii)(B) or (C) of this subsection qualify for leave under this title even though the employee or the family member does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee's health care provider has advised the employee to stay home when the pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe morning sickness.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(24) "Service is localized in this state" has the same meaning as described in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50.04.120'>50.04.120</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(25) "Spouse" means a husband or wife, as the case may be, or state registered domestic partner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(26) "State average weekly wage" means the most recent average weekly wage calculated under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=50.04.355'>50.04.355</a> and available on January 1st of each year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(27) "Supplemental benefit payments" means payments made by an employer to an employee as salary continuation or as paid time off.
