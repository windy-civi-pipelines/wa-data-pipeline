Dual credit programs are an important economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Career and technical education (CTE) dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive a transcripted credit while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer to the postsecondary institution of their choice.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Therefore, the legislature intends to extend and expand a pilot program for the purpose of increasing CTE dual credit participation and credential attainment in professional technical programs, plan for the improvement or replacement of the statewide enrollment and reporting system for CTE dual credit, and receive recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50'>28B.50</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the college board shall administer, and award grant funding to, up to three regional pilot programs, for the purpose of increasing career and technical education dual credit participation and credential attainment in professional technical programs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) One pilot program must be a continuation of the pilot program established in section 601(47)(a), chapter 376, Laws of 2024.
