The state's rich soils, diverse microclimates, and transportation networks support market diversity and the state's diverse agricultural sector is essential to local community resilience and prosperity.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that global organic sales have grown by 10 to 15 percent annually over the past 15 years and that there is high local consumer demand for organic food. Organic agriculture offers an opportunity for farmers, ranchers, food processors, and other businesses to diversify their operations and participate in higher value markets.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature further finds that organic, regenerative, sustainable, and climate-smart agricultural practices help preserve the environment, support economic growth, and improve human health. These environmental and health effects result in additional societal economic benefits not reflected in the direct economic benefits to producers.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature further finds that producers face a significant expense in achieving organic certification.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature intends to identify and remove existing regulatory and market barriers that are preventing agricultural producers from integrating organic and regenerative practices and accessing certified organic markets. This may include developing a statewide organic action plan, lowering certification costs, identifying the need for new financing vehicles or additional wholesale and retail infrastructure and partnerships, and identifying other policies. The legislature further intends to enact policies to enable more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable agriculture, to effectively contribute to food availability, accessibility, affordability, and allow our farms to continue to thrive.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=15.86'>15.86</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department shall develop an organic agriculture action plan to help create opportunities for farmers wishing to transition to organic farming, increase resiliency in agricultural methods, and build a robust regional food system.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) When developing the organic agriculture action plan, the department shall consider and provide recommendations, as appropriate, on elements including, but not limited to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Identifying barriers to achieving organic certification;
