This ultimately had a negative impact on vaccine confidence and the centers for disease control and prevention's credibility now that the unproven claim has been retracted.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Therefore, in order to restore and maintain trust in public health messaging, the legislature intends that all policies and communications related to food and drug administration-regulated products, treatments, or devices follow the same promotional instructions and limitations provided in food and drug administration authorization or approval and be free from unproven claims or promotional language that could mislead consumers.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Department" means the department of health.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Executive branch" means the Washington state governor, state agencies, and the directors, secretaries, and staff of those agencies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Food and drug administration labeling" means the conditions of authorization or approval as granted in letters that specify conditions related to printed matter, advertising, promotion, and other requirements.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Food and drug administration regulated product" means any drug, biological product, medical device, food, or other product regulated by the food and drug administration, including the general class of products when a specific product is not mentioned.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The department, other executive branch actors, and local health departments may only promote, distribute, or endorse food and drug administration-regulated products in compliance with the same terms and conditions specified in food and drug administration labeling.
