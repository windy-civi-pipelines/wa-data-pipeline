Washington is also unique among most states in that in addition to its commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, it has established goals to grow the clean energy sector and reduce the state's expenditures on imported fuels.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature further finds that Washington should continue its leadership on climate change policy by creating accountability for achieving the emission reductions established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>, participating in the design of a regional multisector market-based system to help achieve those emission reductions, assessing other market strategies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, maintaining and enhancing the state's ability to continue to sequester carbon through natural and working lands and forest products, and ensuring the state has a well<span style="text-decoration:underline;">-</span>trained workforce for our clean energy future. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Climate policy leadership and full accountability for achieving emission reductions includes consistent tracking and annual reporting of statewide emissions in a greenhouse gas inventory as required under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) It is the intent of the legislature that the state will: (a) Limit and reduce emissions of greenhouse gas consistent with the emission reductions established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>; (b) minimize the potential to export pollution, jobs, and economic opportunities; (c) support industry sectors that can act as sequesterers of carbon; and (d) reduce emissions at the lowest cost to Washington's economy, consumers, and businesses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) In the event the state elects to participate in a regional multisector market-based system, it is the intent of the legislature that the system will become effective by January 1, 2012, after authority is provided to the department for its implementation. By acting now, Washington businesses and citizens will have adequate time and opportunities to be well positioned to take advantage of the low carbon economy and to make necessary investments in low carbon technology.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) It is also the intent of the legislature that the regional multisector market-based system recognize Washington's unique emissions and sequestration portfolio, including the:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) State's hydroelectric system;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Opportunities presented by Washington's abundant forest resources and the associated forest products industry, along with aquatic and agriculture land and the associated industries; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) State's leadership in energy efficiency and the actions it has already taken that have reduced its generation of greenhouse gas emissions and that entities receive appropriate credit for early actions to reduce greenhouse gases.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) If any revenues, excluding those from state trust lands, that accrue to the state are created by a market system, they must be used for the purposes established in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65'>70A.65</a> RCW and to further the state's efforts to achieve the goals established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a>, address the impacts of global warming on affected habitats, species, and communities, promote and invest in industry sectors that act as sequesterers of carbon, and increase investment in the clean energy economy particularly for communities and workers that have suffered from heavy job losses and chronic unemployment and underemployment.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.45.020'>70A.45.020</a> and 2020 c 79 s 2, 2020 c 32 s 4, and 2020 c 20 s 1398 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) The state shall limit anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases to achieve the following emission reductions for Washington state:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) By 2020, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to 1990 levels, or ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ninety million five hundred thousand</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">90,500,000</span> metric tons;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) By 2030, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">fifty million</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">50,000,000</span> metric tons, or ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">forty-five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">45</span> percent below 1990 levels;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) By 2040, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">twenty-seven million</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">27,000,000</span> metric tons, or ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">seventy</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">70</span> percent below 1990 levels;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) By 2050, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">five million</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">5,000,000</span> metric tons, or ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ninety-five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">95</span> percent below 1990 levels.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) By December 1, 2008, the department shall submit a greenhouse gas reduction plan for review and approval to the legislature, describing those actions necessary to achieve the emission reductions in (a) of this subsection by using existing statutory authority and any additional authority granted by the legislature.
