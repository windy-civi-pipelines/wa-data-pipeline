Therefore, beginning July 1, 2025, the legislature intends to modify the system for establishing nursing home payment rates.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.561'>74.46.561</a> and 2023 c 475 s 942 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The legislature adopts a new system for establishing nursing home payment rates beginning July 1, 2016. Any payments to nursing homes for services provided after June 30, 2016, must be based on the new system. The new system must be designed in such a manner as to decrease administrative complexity associated with the payment methodology, reward nursing homes providing care for high acuity residents, incentivize quality care for residents of nursing homes, and establish minimum staffing standards for direct care.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Beginning July 1, 2025, nursing home payment rates must be rebased annually to the most recent historical cost data.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(3)</span> The new system must be based primarily on industry-wide costs, and have three main components: Direct care, indirect care, and capital.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(3)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(4)</span>(a) The direct care component must include the direct care and therapy care components of the previous system, along with food, laundry, and dietary services. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, direct care must be paid at a fixed rate, based on one hundred percent or greater of statewide case mix neutral median costs, but shall be capped so that a nursing home provider's direct care rate does not exceed 118 percent of its base year's direct care allowable costs except if the provider is below the minimum staffing standard established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.42.360'>74.42.360</a>(2). Direct care must be performance-adjusted for acuity every six months, using case mix principles. Direct care must be regionally adjusted using countywide wage index information available through the United States department of labor's bureau of labor statistics. There is no minimum occupancy for direct care. The direct care component rate allocations calculated in accordance with this section must be adjusted to the extent necessary to comply with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.421'>74.46.421</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Unless a nursing home provider is below the minimum staffing standard established in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.42.360'>74.42.360</a>(2), a provider's direct care rate relative to its base year's direct care allowable costs must be capped as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) For fiscal year 2023, the cap must not exceed 165 percent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) For fiscal year 2024, the cap must not exceed 153 percent; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) For fiscal year 2025, the cap must not exceed 142 percent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(4)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(5)</span>(a) The indirect care component must include the elements of administrative expenses, maintenance costs, and housekeeping services from the previous system. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, a minimum occupancy assumption of ninety percent must be applied to indirect care. Indirect care must be paid at a fixed rate, based on ninety percent or greater of statewide median costs. The indirect care component rate allocations calculated in accordance with this section must be adjusted to the extent necessary to comply with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.421'>74.46.421</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A minimum occupancy assumption must be applied to indirect care as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) For fiscal year 2023, the assumption must be 75 percent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) For fiscal year 2024, the assumption must be 80 percent; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) For fiscal year 2025, the assumption must be 80 percent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(5)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(6)</span> The capital component must use a fair market rental system to set a price per bed. The capital component must be adjusted for the age of the facility, and must use a minimum occupancy assumption of ninety percent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Beginning July 1, 2016, the fair rental rate allocation for each facility must be determined by multiplying the allowable nursing home square footage in (c) of this subsection by the RSMeans rental rate in (d) of this subsection and by the number of licensed beds yielding the gross unadjusted building value. An equipment allowance of ten percent must be added to the unadjusted building value. The sum of the unadjusted building value and equipment allowance must then be reduced by the average age of the facility as determined by (e) of this subsection using a depreciation rate of one and one-half percent. The depreciated building and equipment plus land valued at ten percent of the gross unadjusted building value before depreciation must then be multiplied by the rental rate at seven and one-half percent to yield an allowable fair rental value for the land, building, and equipment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The fair rental value determined in (a) of this subsection must be divided by the greater of the actual total facility census from the prior full calendar year or imputed census based on the number of licensed beds at ninety percent occupancy.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) For the rate year beginning July 1, 2016, all facilities must be reimbursed using four hundred square feet. For the rate year beginning July 1, 2017, allowable nursing facility square footage must be determined using the total nursing facility square footage as reported on the medicaid cost reports submitted to the department in compliance with this chapter. The maximum allowable square feet per bed may not exceed four hundred fifty.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Each facility must be paid at eighty-three percent or greater of the median nursing facility RSMeans construction index value per square foot. The department may use updated RSMeans construction index information when more recent square footage data becomes available. The statewide value per square foot must be indexed based on facility zip code by multiplying the statewide value per square foot times the appropriate zip code based index. For the purpose of implementing this section, the value per square foot effective July 1, 2016, must be set so that the weighted average fair rental value rate is not less than ten dollars and eighty cents per patient day. The capital component rate allocations calculated in accordance with this section must be adjusted to the extent necessary to comply with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.421'>74.46.421</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The average age is the actual facility age reduced for significant renovations. Significant renovations are defined as those renovations that exceed two thousand dollars per bed in a calendar year as reported on the annual cost report submitted in accordance with this chapter. For the rate beginning July 1, 2016, the department shall use renovation data back to 1994 as submitted on facility cost reports. Beginning July 1, 2016, facility ages must be reduced in future years if the value of the renovation completed in any year exceeds two thousand dollars times the number of licensed beds. The cost of the renovation must be divided by the accumulated depreciation per bed in the year of the renovation to determine the equivalent number of new replacement beds. The new age for the facility is a weighted average with the replacement bed equivalents reflecting an age of zero and the existing licensed beds, minus the new bed equivalents, reflecting their age in the year of the renovation. At no time may the depreciated age be less than zero or greater than forty-four years.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) A nursing facility's capital component rate allocation must be rebased annually, effective July 1, 2016, in accordance with this section and this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) For the purposes of this subsection ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(5)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(6)</span>, "RSMeans" means building construction costs data as published by Gordian.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(6)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(7)</span> A quality incentive must be offered as a rate enhancement beginning July 1, 2016.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) An enhancement no larger than five percent and no less than one percent of the statewide average daily rate must be paid to facilities that meet or exceed the standard established for the quality incentive. All providers must have the opportunity to earn the full quality incentive payment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The quality incentive component must be determined by calculating an overall facility quality score composed of four to six quality measures. For fiscal year 2017 there shall be four quality measures, and for fiscal year 2018 there shall be six quality measures. Initially, the quality incentive component must be based on minimum data set quality measures for the percentage of long-stay residents who self-report moderate to severe pain, the percentage of high-risk long-stay residents with pressure ulcers, the percentage of long-stay residents experiencing one or more falls with major injury, and the percentage of long-stay residents with a urinary tract infection. Quality measures must be reviewed on an annual basis by a stakeholder work group established by the department. Upon review, quality measures may be added or changed. The department may risk adjust individual quality measures as it deems appropriate.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The facility quality score must be point based, using at a minimum the facility's most recent available three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data. Point thresholds for each quality measure must be established using the corresponding statistical values for the quality measure point determinants of eighty quality measure points, sixty quality measure points, forty quality measure points, and twenty quality measure points, identified in the most recent available five-star quality rating system technical user's guide published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Facilities meeting or exceeding the highest performance threshold (top level) for a quality measure receive twenty-five points. Facilities meeting the second highest performance threshold receive twenty points. Facilities meeting the third level of performance threshold receive fifteen points. Facilities in the bottom performance threshold level receive no points. Points from all quality measures must then be summed into a single aggregate quality score for each facility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Facilities receiving an aggregate quality score of eighty percent of the overall available total score or higher must be placed in the highest tier (tier V), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between seventy and seventy-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the second highest tier (tier IV), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between sixty and sixty-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the third highest tier (tier III), facilities receiving an aggregate score of between fifty and fifty-nine percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the fourth highest tier (tier II), and facilities receiving less than fifty percent of the overall available total score must be placed in the lowest tier (tier I).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The tier system must be used to determine the amount of each facility's per patient day quality incentive component. The per patient day quality incentive component for tier IV is seventy-five percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V, the per patient day quality incentive component for tier III is fifty percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V, and the per patient day quality incentive component for tier II is twenty-five percent of the per patient day quality incentive component for tier V. Facilities in tier I receive no quality incentive component.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Tier system payments must be set in a manner that ensures that the entire biennial appropriation for the quality incentive program is allocated.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Facilities with insufficient three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data must be assigned to the tier corresponding to their five-star quality rating. Facilities with a five-star quality rating must be assigned to the highest tier (tier V) and facilities with a one-star quality rating must be assigned to the lowest tier (tier I). The use of a facility's five-star quality rating shall only occur in the case of insufficient centers for medicare and medicaid services minimum data set information.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The quality incentive rates must be adjusted semiannually on July 1 and January 1 of each year using, at a minimum, the most recent available three-quarter average centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) Beginning July 1, 2017, the percentage of short-stay residents who newly received an antipsychotic medication must be added as a quality measure. The department must determine the quality incentive thresholds for this quality measure in a manner consistent with those outlined in (b) through (h) of this subsection using the centers for medicare and medicaid services quality data.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) Beginning July 1, 2017, the percentage of direct care staff turnover must be added as a quality measure using the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal and nursing home facility payroll data. Turnover is defined as an employee departure. The department must determine the quality incentive thresholds for this quality measure using data from the centers for medicare and medicaid services' payroll-based journal, unless such data is not available, in which case the department shall use direct care staffing turnover data from the most recent medicaid cost report.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(7)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(8)</span> Reimbursement of the safety net assessment imposed by chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.48'>74.48</a> RCW and paid in relation to medicaid residents must be continued.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(8)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(9)</span>(a) The direct care and indirect care components must be rebased ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">in even-numbered years</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">annually</span>, beginning with rates paid on July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2016</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2025</span>. Rates paid on July 1, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2016</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2025</span>, must be based on the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">2014</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2023</span> calendar year cost report. On a percentage basis, after rebasing, the department must confirm that the statewide average daily rate has increased at least as much as the average rate of inflation, as determined by the skilled nursing facility market basket index published by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, or a comparable index. If after rebasing, the percentage increase to the statewide average daily rate is less than the average rate of inflation for the same time period, the department is authorized to increase rates by the difference between the percentage increase after rebasing and the average rate of inflation.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) It is the intention of the legislature that direct and indirect care rates paid in fiscal year 2022 will be rebased using the calendar year 2019 cost reports. For fiscal year 2021, in addition to the rates generated by (a) of this subsection, an additional adjustment is provided as established in this subsection ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(8)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(9)</span>(b). Beginning May 1, 2020, and through June 30, 2021, the calendar year costs must be adjusted for inflation by a twenty-four month consumer price index, based on the most recently available monthly index for all urban consumers, as published by the bureau of labor statistics. It is also the intent of the legislature that, starting in fiscal year 2022, a facility-specific rate add-on equal to the inflation adjustment that facilities received solely in fiscal year 2021, must be added to the rate. For fiscal year 2024, the direct care and indirect care components shall be rebased to the 2021 calendar year cost report plus a 4.7 percent adjustment for inflation. For fiscal year 2025, the direct and indirect care components shall be rebased to the 2022 calendar year cost report plus a five percent adjustment for inflation.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) To determine the necessity of regular inflationary adjustments to the nursing facility rates, by December 1, 2020, the department shall provide the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the legislature with a report that provides a review of rates paid in 2017, 2018, and 2019 in comparison to costs incurred by nursing facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(9)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(10)</span> The direct care component provided in subsection ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(3)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(4)</span> of this section is subject to the reconciliation and settlement process provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.022'>74.46.022</a>(6). Beginning July 1, 2016, pursuant to rules established by the department, funds that are received through the reconciliation and settlement process provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.46.022'>74.46.022</a>(6) must be used for technical assistance, specialized training, or an increase to the quality enhancement established in subsection ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">(6)</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">(7)</span> of this section.
