Trains of 10,000 to 15,000 feet in length are regularly traversing our state, while trains greater than 20,000 feet in length have been operating within this state and their operation has become commonplace in other states.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Excessively long trains operating over the unique and widely varying geographical terrain in Washington create a significant safety risk to the public and the environment, especially considering that railroad infrastructure and operational technologies do not exist to ensure the safe movement of excessively long trains. The state has an obligation and the authority to ensure railroad operational safety, security, and, in the event of a hazardous material incident, to support first responder activities, the safety of our communities, the expeditious response of emergency services, and the health and welfare of passengers, the public, and railroad employees.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Therefore, the legislature declares that this act regulating the length of trains to reduce risk to the public and our localities constitutes an exercise of the state's police power to protect and promote the health, safety, security, and welfare of the residents of the state by reducing the risk exposure to local communities and protecting environmentally sensitive and/or pristine lands and waterways.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Commission" means the utilities and transportation commission created in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=80.01'>80.01</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Noncompliant" means a train that does not meet the requirements of section 3(1) of this act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Railroad carrier" means a carrier of persons or property upon vehicles, other than streetcars, operated upon stationary rails, the route of which is principally outside incorporated cities and towns.
