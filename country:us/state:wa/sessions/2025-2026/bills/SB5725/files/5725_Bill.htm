The legislature also finds that increased housing instability is overwhelmingly caused by rising rents, which are exacerbated by very low vacancy rates, making it difficult for people to find housing even when they have sufficient income to pay market rates. Low housing vacancies, population growth, and limited housing supply have created a housing shortage in which existing inventory is priced at a premium.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature also finds that although household incomes have grown along with the economy, wage increases, especially for those in public service, frontline work, and education, have not kept pace with rising rents and home prices. This problem is especially impacting moderate, lower, and fixed-income households, including frontline workers, public employees, educators, students, seniors, veterans, farmworkers, and people with disabilities. These households face increasing barriers to securing stable housing near their workplaces and schools, forcing many to commute long distances or relocate entirely.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature recognizes that housing instability among public sector employees and frontline workers directly affects the quality and continuity of essential services, including education, health care, and emergency response. Additionally, high housing costs have made it difficult for state institutions of higher education to attract and retain faculty and staff, contributing to turnover that disrupts student learning and creates inefficiencies in recruitment, hiring, and training.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that ensuring access to stable, affordable housing for employees, faculty, and students is critical to the success of schools, public institutions, and local economies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to increase the supply of housing and expand affordable housing opportunities for Washington's workforce, including public employees, frontline workers, and educational faculty, staff, and students, by removing barriers and encouraging the development of affordable housing on underutilized land at community and technical colleges across Washington, ensuring that those who contribute to the vitality of their communities have the opportunity to live within them.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50.090'>28B.50.090</a> and 2013 c 57 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The college board shall have general supervision and control over the state system of community and technical colleges.
