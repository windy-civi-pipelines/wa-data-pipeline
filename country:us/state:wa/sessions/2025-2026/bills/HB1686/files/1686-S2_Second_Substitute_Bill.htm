A 2023 report by the office of the insurance commissioner identified that Washington has experienced substantial horizontal consolidation and vertical integration across health care providers, facilities, and insurers;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Washington's health care market is also experiencing investment from new for-profit entities such as private equity firms.Â While there were only four private equity acquisitions in Washington in 2014, this number had grown to 97 by 2023;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) These changes to Washington's health care landscape have not resolved access and affordability challenges. A 2024 survey of over 1,000 Washingtonians found that over half skipped needed care due to cost. Department of health data indicates substantial health disparities based on geographic location. Many rural Washingtonians experience health care deserts for essential care; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d)Â Washington is currently unable to evaluate how changes in the health care landscape are impacting access and affordability because the state lacks a complete and transparent registry of health care systems and entities. While the state collects some information about health insurers through annual financial statement filing requirements, there is no similar information available for other kinds of health care systems and entities.Â The office of financial management identified this critical data infrastructure gap in 2010, but it has not yet been resolved. Recent reports in 2023 and 2024 by the office of financial management, the office of the insurance commissioner, and the health care cost transparency board have indicated this data gap continues to prevent effective stewardship of health care resources and state health planning.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to monitor and measure changes in the health care landscape to better understand trends in health care market consolidation, with the goal of improving access and affordability.Â The legislature aims to accelerate transparency about large health care systems and entities first, prioritizing data collection at the holding company or parent entity level to inform the development of a more complete, interactive registry that includes all health care entities and providers over time.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Affiliate" means:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A person, entity, or organization that directly, indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control or ownership of another person, entity, or organization;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A person, entity, or organization that operates all or a substantial part of the health care services or property of a health care entity under a lease, management, or operating agreement; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Any in-state or out-of-state operations or corporate affiliates of an affiliate as defined in this subsection, including private equity funds, health care real estate investment trusts, or management services organizations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Business identification number" includes taxpayer identification number, health care entity national provider identifier, centers for medicare and medicaid services certification number, national association of insurance commissioners identification number, and health care benefit manager office of the insurance commissioner registration number.
