The commissioner shall define the circumstances under which a carrier may submit an alternate access delivery request and the requirements for submission and approval of such a request in rule. To submit an alternate access delivery request, a carrier shall:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Ensure that enrollees will not bear any greater cost of receiving services under the alternate access delivery request than if the provider or facility was contracted with the carrier or make other
arrangements acceptable to the commissioner;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Provide substantial evidence of good faith efforts on its part to contract with providers or facilities. If a carrier is submitting an alternate access delivery request for the same service and geographic area as a previously approved request, the carrier shall provide new or additional evidence of good faith efforts to contract associated with the current request;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) Demonstrate that there is not an available provider or facility with which the carrier can contract to meet the commissioner's provider network standards; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) For services for which balance billing is prohibited under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.49.020'>48.49.020</a>, notify out-of-network providers or facilities that deliver the services referenced in the alternate access delivery request within five days of submitting the request to the commissioner. Any notification provided under this subsection shall include contact information for carrier staff who can provide detailed information to the affected provider or facility regarding the submitted alternate access delivery request.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) For services for which balance billing is prohibited under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.49.020'>48.49.020</a>, a carrier may not treat its payment of nonparticipating providers or facilities under this chapter or P.L. 116-260 (enacted December 27, 2020) as a means to satisfy network access standards established by the commissioner unless all requirements of this subsection are met.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) If a carrier is unable to obtain a contract with a provider or facility delivering services addressed in an alternate access delivery request to meet network access requirements, the carrier may ask the commissioner to amend the alternate access delivery request if the carrier's communication to the commissioner occurs at least three months after the effective date of the alternate access delivery request and demonstrates substantial evidence of good faith efforts on its part to contract for delivery of services during that three-month time period. If the carrier has demonstrated substantial evidence of good faith efforts on its part to contract, the commissioner shall allow a carrier to use the dispute resolution process provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.49.040'>48.49.040</a> to determine the amount that will be paid to providers or facilities for services referenced in the alternate access delivery request.
