Such illegal activities have resulted in death in the past that could have been avoided. This act provides consequences for endangering people, impeding emergency vehicles, and blocking the freedom of movement of others. The legislature recognizes the right to peacefully assemble. Endangering people's lives, the traveling public, and law enforcement officers is not part of a civil society when there are plenty of legal and safe times and locations for public discourse and assemblies.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61'>46.61</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A person is guilty of obstructing highways if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The person, acting with three or more persons together, intentionally obstructs vehicular traffic by walking, standing, or sitting in a manner that blocks without lawful authority the ability of a vehicle to drive on a state highway.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Except as provided for in (c) of this subsection, obstructing highways is a gross misdemeanor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) It is a class C felony if a person is a leader or organizer of the people engaging in obstructing highways and must pay a monetary penalty of at least $5,000, which may not be reduced to an amount less than $1,000.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A person is guilty of obstructing highways in disregard for public safety if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a)(i) A person, acting with three or more persons together, intentionally obstructs vehicular traffic on a state highway by walking, standing, or sitting without legal authority;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The person's activity creates a risk causing injury to any person or property;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The person's activity impedes an ambulance; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) The person refuses or fails to disperse when ordered to do so by a police officer or public official engaged in enforcing the law.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Obstructing highways in disregard for public safety is a class C felony.
