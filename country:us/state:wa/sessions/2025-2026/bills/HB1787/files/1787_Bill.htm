Soaring substance use rates have served as a leading contributor to increases in crime and homelessness which is plaguing communities throughout our state. While the legislature has taken steps to address this crisis through the passage of Ricky's law and dedicating increased funding for building treatment capacity, the substance use problem only continues to grow. In recognition of this crisis, the legislature intends to fully implement new standards for involuntary treatment commitment for individuals suffering from substance use disorder who are an immediate danger to the community or themselves. The legislature and mental health professionals recognized the need for new involuntary treatment commitment standards upon passage of chapter 302, Laws of 2020, yet these commitment standards have yet to be implemented resulting in an inability for local governments to ensure that each and every individual suffering from a substance use disorder who are a severe threat to the community or themselves are able to receive necessary treatment.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature also recognizes that the substance use crisis in Washington state is geographically widespread and not isolated to only urban communities, and continues to permeate throughout all Washington communities. Therefore, the legislature intends to appropriate additional funding for secure withdrawal management and stabilization facilities in order to build the capacity of treatment beds necessary to ensure each community throughout Washington state has the resources to address the substance use crisis. The legislature finds that communities who are geographically isolated from these facilities face challenges in their ability to refer those suffering from substance use disorder to existing facilities, leading to either limited ability to commit these individuals for treatment or placement in a facility not intended for proper substance use treatment. The perpetuation of this practice has wreaked havoc on communities throughout Washington state. Furthermore, the legislature intends to double the current secure withdrawal management and stabilization facility bed count through incentivizing the creation of these facilities in areas lacking capacity as identified by the health care authority single bed certification and unavailable detention facility reports. This increased treatment capacity is intended to ensure that the increased population of those detained under these new involuntary treatment commitment standards for substance use disorder have access to the proper treatment facilities, and ensures that all communities throughout Washington state have access to these facilities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.05.020'>71.05.020</a> and 2024 c 371 s 17, 2024 c 209 s 5, and 2024 c 62 s 18 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "23-hour crisis relief center" has the same meaning as under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.24.025'>71.24.025</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Admission" or "admit" means a decision by a physician, physician assistant, or psychiatric advanced registered nurse practitioner that a person should be examined or treated as a patient in a hospital;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Alcoholism" means a disease, characterized by a dependency on alcoholic beverages, loss of control over the amount and circumstances of use, symptoms of tolerance, physiological or psychological withdrawal, or both, if use is reduced or discontinued, and impairment of health or disruption of social or economic functioning;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Antipsychotic medications" means that class of drugs primarily used to treat serious manifestations of mental illness associated with thought disorders, which includes, but is not limited to atypical antipsychotic medications;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Approved substance use disorder treatment program" means a program for persons with a substance use disorder provided by a treatment program certified by the department as meeting standards adopted under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.24'>71.24</a> RCW;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Attending staff" means any person on the staff of a public or private agency having responsibility for the care and treatment of a patient;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) "Authority" means the Washington state health care authority;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) "Behavioral health disorder" means either a mental disorder as defined in this section, a substance use disorder as defined in this section, or a co-occurring mental disorder and substance use disorder;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) "Behavioral health service provider" means a public or private agency that provides mental health, substance use disorder, or co-occurring disorder services to persons with behavioral health disorders as defined under this section and receives funding from public sources.
