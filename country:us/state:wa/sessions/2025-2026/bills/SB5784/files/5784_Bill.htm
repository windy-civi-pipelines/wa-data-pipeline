The legislature further finds that chapter 310, Laws of 2021 instructed the joint legislative audit and review committee to perform racial equity analyses as part of its audits of state agencies and programs, yet the committee is unable to fulfill this mandate because most state agencies do not collect the necessary data to fulfill this mission.<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that the federal government office of management and budget published statistical policy directive number 15: Standards for maintaining, collecting, and presenting federal data on race and ethnicity, the goal of which is to ensure the comparability of race and ethnicity across federal data sets and to maximize the quality of the data by ensuring the format, language, and procedures for collecting the data are consistent. While statistical policy directive number 15 provides a minimum set of categories that all federal agencies must use when collecting information on race and ethnicity, that minimum is insufficient for the state of Washington because of its great diversity of ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds, and experiences.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature intends for all state agencies to collect demographic data, beyond those minimum categories listed in statistical policy directive number 15, in sufficient categories and subcategories appropriate for the programs being analyzed. For example, the Asian demographic must be broken down into as many subcategories of ethnicities as is necessary to measure the efficacy of our state-supported programs and determine the efficacy and equity of opportunity and access to those being evaluated. At a minimum, the Asian category must be disaggregated by subcategories including Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, and Indian. Further disaggregation of the subcategories may be necessary depending on the circumstances such as disaggregating: Southeast Asians by Cambodian-Khmer, Thai, Lao, Mien, or Hmong; Pacific Islanders by compacts of free association states, Samoan, or Chamorro; or by language such as Cantonese, Mandarin, or Taishan. It is important for agencies and program administrators to understand that the Asian demographic is not one monolithic common demographic with the same needs or cultures. Therefore, the legislature finds that analyses of state agencies and programs must be based on the appropriate data set collected with regard to the appropriate target demographic categories and subcategories state programs are impacting.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Agency" means any state board, commission, bureau, committee, department, institution, division, or tribunal in the legislative, executive, or judicial branch of state government.
