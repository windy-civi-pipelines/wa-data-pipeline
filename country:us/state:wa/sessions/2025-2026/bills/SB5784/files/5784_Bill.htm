ï»¿S-1667.3SENATE BILL 5784State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenator HasegawaAN ACT Relating to agency demographic data collection; reenacting and amending RCW 28A.300.042; and adding a new chapter to Title 42 RCW.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that the state uses demographic data to measure the efficacy of state-supported programs and determine equity of opportunity and access to many state programs. The legislature further finds that chapter 310, Laws of 2021 instructed the joint legislative audit and review committee to perform racial equity analyses as part of its audits of state agencies and programs, yet the committee is unable to fulfill this mandate because most state agencies do not collect the necessary data to fulfill this mission.The legislature further finds that the federal government office of management and budget published statistical policy directive number 15: Standards for maintaining, collecting, and presenting federal data on race and ethnicity, the goal of which is to ensure the comparability of race and ethnicity across federal data sets and to maximize the quality of the data by ensuring the format, language, and procedures for collecting the data are consistent. While statistical policy directive number 15 provides a minimum set of categories that all federal agencies must use when collecting information on race and ethnicity, that minimum is insufficient for the state of Washington because of its great diversity of ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds, and experiences.The legislature intends for all state agencies to collect demographic data, beyond those minimum categories listed in statistical policy directive number 15, in sufficient categories and subcategories appropriate for the programs being analyzed. For example, the Asian demographic must be broken down into as many subcategories of ethnicities as is necessary to measure the efficacy of our state-supported programs and determine the efficacy and equity of opportunity and access to those being evaluated. At a minimum, the Asian category must be disaggregated by subcategories including Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, and Indian. Further disaggregation of the subcategories may be necessary depending on the circumstances such as disaggregating: Southeast Asians by Cambodian-Khmer, Thai, Lao, Mien, or Hmong; Pacific Islanders by compacts of free association states, Samoan, or Chamorro; or by language such as Cantonese, Mandarin, or Taishan. It is important for agencies and program administrators to understand that the Asian demographic is not one monolithic common demographic with the same needs or cultures. Therefore, the legislature finds that analyses of state agencies and programs must be based on the appropriate data set collected with regard to the appropriate target demographic categories and subcategories state programs are impacting.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Agency" means any state board, commission, bureau, committee, department, institution, division, or tribunal in the legislative, executive, or judicial branch of state government.

(1) Each agency shall collect voluntary self-identification demographic data using the United States office of management and budget statistical policy directive number 15 as published on March 29, 2024, that provides common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and use of race and ethnicity data, minimum categories, and corresponding detailed categories and subcategories.(2) Each agency must consider and base demographic data collection on the appropriate demographic data set necessary with regard to appropriate target demographic categories or subcategories of a program or agency being evaluated.(3) The data collected under subsection (1) of this section must be included in every demographic report on race or ethnic origin by the state agency, board, or commission published or released after June 30, 2025.

(1) An agency may submit a request to the office of financial management for an exemption to the requirement to collect more detailed data beyond the minimum categories if the agency determines that the potential benefit of the detailed data would not justify the additional burden to the agency and the public or the additional risk to privacy or confidentiality.(2) An agency may submit a request to the office of financial management for a variance to the detailed categories if the agency determines that collecting different detailed data categories than the ones listed in United States office of management and budget statistical policy directive number 15 provides more useful or accurate data for the collection's specific context and intended uses. Any variances in detailed data collection must be able to be aggregated up to the required minimum categories.(3) The office of financial management must review agency requests for exemptions and variances, and only approve the requests if they contain sufficient justification.(4) The office of financial management and agencies must consult with the ethnic commissions and the governor's office of Indian affairs regarding which demographic breakdown is most important and relevant to the program or programs being analyzed.Sec. 5.
