The legislature further finds that corporate buyers often target lower-priced starter homes, typically located in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of families of color, working individuals, and single parent families. Leveraging significant financial advantages, such as purchasing homes with cash, these entities outcompete individual buyers and remove homes from the market, reducing opportunities for homeownership and increasing the risk of neighborhood displacement and gentrification. Once acquired, these properties are often converted into rental units or sold in bulk to other entities, permanently reducing the supply of affordable housing available for individual ownership.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->This trend is making a profound impact on Washington's housing market with rapidly rising housing costs, diminishing affordability, and increasing challenges for first-time and lower-income buyers disproportionately impacting working-class families and communities of color.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that transparency is essential to understanding the dynamics of Washington's housing market and responding effectively to its challenges. While progress has been made through local rental registries, there remains a critical gap in tracking and analyzing the scale, nature, and impact of corporate and institutional ownership, particularly in the single-family housing sector. Currently, no centralized system exists to monitor these ownership patterns statewide.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">To address this gap, the legislature intends to establish a corporate homeowner registration program within the office of the secretary of state. This program will require corporate entities to report ownership structures, property uses, and other basic information, ensuring accurate and timely data collection. This data will provide policymakers, local governments, and the public with the tools needed to make informed, evidence-based decisions to preserve housing affordability, equity, and accessibility across the state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">This act constitutes an exercise of the state's responsibility to protect and promote the health, safety, and welfare of Washington's residents. As such, it is intended to foster fairness and transparency in the housing market, mitigate the negative impacts of monopolistic ownership, and support measures to close the racial wealth gap and housing affordability crisis.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The corporate homeowner registration program is established at the office of the secretary of state.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Applicable housing unit" means a single-family residence or a condominium unit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Condominium" means real property, portions of which are designated for separate ownership and the remainder of which is designated for common ownership solely by the owners of those portions.
