In appointing the voting members, the county legislative authority shall divide the county into ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">five</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">four</span> geographical areas that best represent the county's interests, and appoint a voting member from each geographical area <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and one at large member</span>. At least three of the voting members shall be engaged in the primary production of agricultural products. There is one nonvoting member on the board who is the director of the county extension office or an extension agent appointed by the director of the county extension office. Each voting member of the board serves a term of four years, except that the county legislative authority shall, when a board is first activated under this chapter, designate two voting members to serve terms of two years. The board members shall not receive a salary but shall be compensated for actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) The voting members of the board serve until their replacements are appointed. New members of the board shall be appointed at least ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days prior to the expiration of any board member's term of office.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Notice of expiration of a term of office shall be published at least twice in a weekly or daily newspaper of general circulation in the geographical area with last publication occurring at least ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ten</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10</span> days prior to the nomination<span style="text-decoration:underline;">, or by posting on the district's website at least 10 days prior to the nomination</span>.

The county legislative authority, within 60 days of receiving the list of nominees, shall appoint one of those nominees to the county noxious weed control board to represent that geographical area during that term of office. If the county legislative authority fails to appoint a nominee within the 60-day period and a quorum of the board is not seated, the county noxious weed control board shall appoint a nominee only to meet a quorum, who shall serve in that capacity until the county legislative authority appoints a nominee to fill the vacant position in the manner prescribed in this section. Not more than three board members may be appointed in this manner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Within ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days after all the members have been appointed, the board shall conduct its first meeting.
