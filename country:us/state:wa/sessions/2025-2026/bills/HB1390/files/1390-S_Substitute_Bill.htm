If, after the conclusion of the hearing on this issue, the court finds, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person did commit the act or acts charged, it shall enter a final order, appealable by the person, on that issue, and may proceed to consider whether the person should be committed pursuant to this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the state shall comply with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.77.220'>10.77.220</a> while confining the person.
