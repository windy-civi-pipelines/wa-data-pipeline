Preparation for and response to wildfire risk is an increasingly important element of planning conducted by electric utilities. Proper preparation is crucial to position electric utilities to respond to wildfire risk. Knowing what measures should be taken to minimize wildfire risk before it occurs and to respond to it when it does occur is central to the safe, efficient, and reliable provision of an essential public service. It is essential to make sure these risks are addressed, as needed, but also within appropriate cost parameters to keep electric power affordable to the public. This legislation is designed to direct the prudent use of resources by electric utilities to mitigate and respond to wildfire risk within costs that can be justified as fair, just, and reasonable in order to balance wildfire risk with affordable electric rates.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=80.28'>80.28</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) Each electrical company may, as soon as practicable after the effective date of this section, file a wildfire mitigation plan with the commission.

The commission may, in approving with conditions the plan or plan update, make modifications to the plan or plan update that the commission reasonably finds represent a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with the resulting reduction of wildfire risk. The commission shall issue an order explaining any modifications at the time the plan or plan update is approved. In evaluating a plan or plan update, the commission may consult with and consider information from federal, tribal, state, or local governmental entities, utilities, and industry organizations.
