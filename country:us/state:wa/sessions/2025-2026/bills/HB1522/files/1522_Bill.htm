It is the intent of the legislature to provide for the safe, efficient, and reliable transmission and distribution of electric power at affordable rates.

Knowing what measures should be taken to minimize wildfire risk before it occurs and to respond to it when it does occur is central to the safe, efficient, and reliable provision of an essential public service. It is essential to make sure these risks are addressed, as needed, but also within appropriate cost parameters to keep electric power affordable to the public. This legislation is designed to direct the prudent use of resources by electric utilities to mitigate and respond to wildfire risk within costs that can be justified as fair, just, and reasonable in order to balance wildfire risk with affordable electric rates.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.

The company shall update a plan no less frequently than every three years. The company shall provide a copy of its wildfire mitigation plan and updates to the department of natural resources and the utility wildland fire prevention advisory committee created in RCW 76.04.780.(b) Nothing in this subsection prohibits an electrical company from updating its wildfire mitigation plan more often than required under subsection (1)(a) of this section.(2) The commission must approve, reject, or approve with conditions, after a public meeting, an electrical company's wildfire mitigation plan or plan update within 60 days of the filing of such plan.

The commission may, in approving with conditions the plan or plan update, make modifications to the plan or plan update that the commission reasonably finds represent a reasonable balancing of mitigation costs with the resulting reduction of wildfire risk. The commission shall issue an order explaining any modifications at the time the plan or plan update is approved. In evaluating a plan or plan update, the commission may consult with and consider information from federal, tribal, state, or local governmental entities, utilities, and industry organizations. The commission shall describe the nature of its consultations with third parties in its order approving or approving with conditions a plan or plan update.(3) The commission may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include, but need not be limited to, procedures and standards regarding vegetation management, public power safety shutoffs and service restoration, pole materials, circuitry, and monitoring systems.(4) The commission is not liable for an electrical company's implementation of its wildfire mitigation plan. There is no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature may arise against, the state, commission, commissioners, commission staff, or commission representatives, agents, or consultants for the death of or injury to persons, or property damage, for any action taken by them in the performance of their powers and duties exercised under this section.Sec. 3.

The commission may by rule waive any or all of the minimum fee established pursuant to this ((section))subsection (1).(2) The percentage rates of gross operating revenue to be paid in any year may be decreased by the commission for any class of companies subject to the payment of such fees, by general order entered before March 1st of such year, and for such purpose such companies shall be classified as follows: Electrical, gas, water, telecommunications, and irrigation companies shall constitute class one. Every other company subject to regulation by the commission, for which regulatory fees are not otherwise fixed by law shall pay fees as herein provided and shall constitute additional classes according to kinds of businesses engaged in.(3) The commission shall collect a reasonable fee from an electrical company in addition to the fee in subsection (1) of this section for the purposes of section 2 of this act.(4) Any payment of the fee imposed by subsection (1) of this section made after its due date shall include a late fee of two percent of the amount due.
