ï»¿S-0283.1SENATE BILL 5216State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Shewmake, Chapman, and NoblesPrefiled 01/09/25.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology.AN ACT Relating to green energy community funds to support school districts and nonprofit organizations that service the communities where renewable energy projects are located; amending RCW 28A.325.030; adding a new chapter to Title 82 RCW; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that green energy provides economic and environmental benefits by creating opportunities for jobs, and innovation by replacing dirtier forms of energy. The legislature further finds that many, but not all, of these benefits occur at the regional and global levels, beyond the districts where projects are located. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a program to ensure those broad benefits are shared with the host communities by creating pathways to invest state tax revenue back into local communities. This act provides community benefits by creating a mechanism to ensure that more of the taxes from new green energy projects are fed back into the districts where they are located.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.

(1) Application for tax credits under this chapter must be submitted to the department before making a contribution to a recipient. The application must be made to the department in a form and manner prescribed by the department.

The department must rule on the application within 45 days. Applications must be approved on a first-in-time basis.(2) Applications must be submitted between January 1st and July 1st for contributions to be made by the qualifying light and power business during the calendar year; however, the department may extend the application deadline if a qualifying light and power business does not make a contribution by the date specified in section 4 of this act and forfeits all tax credits for the approved application.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4. (1) A qualifying light and power business approved for credit as provided under section 3 of this act must make the total approved contribution to the recipient by October 1st of the calendar year in which the application is approved. If October 1st falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the payment to the recipient of the contribution is timely if sent on the next business day.(2)(a) A qualifying light and power business that does not make a contribution as required in subsection (1) of this section forfeits all credits for the approved contribution.(b) The department must make credits forfeited as provided in (a) of this subsection available to new applicants.(3) A qualifying light and power business must provide proof of payment of the contribution to the department by October 15th of the calendar year in which the contribution is made to the recipient.

(1) Subject to the limitations in this chapter, a credit is allowed against the tax imposed by chapters 82.04 and 82.16 RCW for approved contributions that are made by a qualifying light and power business to a recipient.(2) The credit allowed under this section is limited to an amount equal to 75 percent of the approved contribution made by a qualifying light and power business to a recipient.(3) The department must keep a running total of all credits approved under this chapter for each calendar year. The department may not approve any credits under this section that would cause the total amount of approved credits statewide to exceed $5,000,000 in any calendar year.(4) The total credits allowed under this chapter for a qualifying light and power business may not exceed $250,000 in a calendar year.(5) The credit may be claimed against tax due under chapters 82.04 and 82.16 RCW from a renewable energy project only in the calendar year in which the credit was approved by the department and the contribution was made to the recipient or in the subsequent calendar year.
