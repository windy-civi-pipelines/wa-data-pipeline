The legislature further finds that many, but not all, of these benefits occur at the regional and global levels, beyond the districts where projects are located. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a program to ensure those broad benefits are shared with the host communities by creating pathways to invest state tax revenue back into local communities. This act provides community benefits by creating a mechanism to ensure that more of the taxes from new green energy projects are fed back into the districts where they are located.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Applicant" means a person applying for a tax credit under this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Contribution" means cash contributions by a qualifying light and power business.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Department" means the department of revenue.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Person" has the meaning given in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.030'>82.04.030</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Qualifying light and power business" means a light and power business as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.16.010'>82.16.010</a> with a renewable energy project located within the boundaries of a school district.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Recipient" means a school district with a renewable energy project located within the boundaries of the school district or a nonprofit organization that services the community where a renewable energy project is located.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) "Renewable energy project" means a facility constructed after the effective date of this section and used by a qualifying light and power business to generate electricity derived either from wind power or solar power or to store electrical energy.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) Application for tax credits under this chapter must be submitted to the department before making a contribution to a recipient.
