The mental and behavioral health crisis for children and youth in the United States has reached a critical point. The legislature also recognizes that behavioral health and wellness supports for K-12 students in Washington are fragmented, with roles and responsibilities assigned across several local and state agencies. The department of health, the Washington state health care authority, and the office of the superintendent of public instruction all play significant but distinct roles, as do regional educational service districts, local school districts, and community partners. Nonetheless, schools are often community hubs making them a natural setting for prevention, early intervention, and service delivery related to mental and behavioral health so that students can fully access their right to a basic education.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature also recognizes the investments made to support student behavioral health and well-being and that despite those investments, school districts lack the dedicated funding and coordinated supports necessary to deploy comprehensive supports and direct services across the behavioral health continuum for their students.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create a connected statewide network for student mental and behavioral health to maintain, expand, and provide oversight to Washington's school-based mental and behavioral health system for children and adolescents across the state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.300'>28A.300</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction, in collaboration with local education agencies, the Washington association of educational service districts, and other state agencies as applicable, including the health care authority, the department of health, and the department of children, youth, and families, shall (a) establish strategic direction and goals for statewide programming to strengthen the capacity of local education agencies to meet the recognition, initial screening, and response requirements outlined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.127'>28A.320.127</a> and (b) provide state-level coordination to help schools better promote mental well-being as well as identify and connect students to behavioral health supports in school and interconnected community settings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) At a minimum, the state-level coordination and strategic direction and goals mandated in subsection (1) of this section must include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) In alignment with the Washington integrated student supports protocol, tools, guidance, and supports for school districts to offer coordinated student supports related to behavioral health, including prevention and awareness, student engagement, and student access to the full continuum of school-based behavioral health services;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Guidance and streamline processes to maximize access to state and federal resources;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Coordination with training and technical assistance entities who support local education agencies in designing, funding, and implementing comprehensive student behavioral health supports based on the tools, guidance, and supports established in (a) of this subsection;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Evidence-based practices, including practices aligned with the Washington integrated student supports protocol that support mental and behavioral health services in school districts;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Coordination with organizations representing school board members, district and building-level leadership, educators, and other school staff to support school district implementation of chapter 129, Laws of 2021;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Support of local education agencies through guidance and technical assistance in facilitating student access to mental and behavioral health supports and reduction of barriers to school-based behavioral health services;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Resources to support local education agencies in deploying student school-based substance use and behavioral health screening, intervention, and referral activities in alignment to promising and evidence-based practices;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Foundational school substance abuse prevention and intervention resources to address the health and well-being impacts of drug use, including education to promote behaviors that positively influence student behavioral health;
