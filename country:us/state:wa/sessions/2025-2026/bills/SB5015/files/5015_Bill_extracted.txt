ï»¿S-0004.2SENATE BILL 5015State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Boehnke, Chapman, Christian, Dozier, Fortunato, Harris, Short, Wagoner, and J. WilsonPrefiled 12/05/24.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology.AN ACT Relating to increasing efficiency at the energy facility site evaluation council by removing the governor from the project approval process; amending RCW 80.50.040, 80.50.045, 80.50.060, 80.50.071, 80.50.090, 80.50.100, 80.50.105, 80.50.130, 80.50.330, 70A.15.3130, 80.70.020, 80.80.040, 90.48.262, and 90.58.140; creating a new section; and repealing RCW 80.50.320.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that the energy facility site evaluation process culminates in a recommendation to the governor as the final step in the process. The legislature determines that the site evaluation process would be improved if the council were authorized to make the final decision without the necessity of making a recommendation to the governor. The council is the primary decision maker in the site evaluation process, having reviewed and considered all evidence, reports, comments, and submissions by the parties and participants in an adjudicative proceeding. With respect to the office of the governor, the governor's role in the process, apart from appointing the chair of the council, is not a critical piece of the overall project review, and the efficiency and speediness of the site evaluation process would be streamlined by making the council the final decision maker on the projects it reviews.Sec. 2. RCW 80.50.040 and 2022 c 183 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:The council shall have the following powers:(1) To adopt, promulgate, amend, or rescind suitable rules and regulations, pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, to carry out the provisions of this chapter, and the policies and practices of the council in connection therewith;(2) To develop and apply environmental and ecological guidelines in relation to the type, design, location, construction, initial operational conditions of certification, and ongoing regulatory oversight under the regulatory authority established in this chapter of energy facilities subject to this chapter;(3) To establish rules of practice for the conduct of public hearings pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, as found in chapter 34.05 RCW;(4) To prescribe the form, content, and necessary supporting documentation for site certification;(5) To receive applications for energy facility locations and to investigate the sufficiency thereof;(6) To enter into contracts to carry out the provisions of this chapter;(7) To conduct hearings on the proposed location and operational conditions of the energy facilities under the regulatory authority established in this chapter;(8) To prepare written reports ((to the governor)) which shall include: (a) A statement indicating whether the application is in compliance with the council's guidelines, (b) criteria specific to the site and transmission line routing, (c) a council ((recommendation))decision as to the disposition of the application, and (d) a ((draft)) certification agreement when the council ((recommends approval of))approves the application;(9) To prescribe the means for monitoring of the effects arising from the construction and the operation of energy facilities to assure continued compliance with terms of certification and/or permits issued by the council pursuant to chapter 90.48 RCW or subsection (12) of this section: PROVIDED, That any on-site inspection required by the council shall be performed by other state agencies pursuant to interagency agreement: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the council may retain authority for determining compliance relative to monitoring;(10) To integrate its site evaluation activity with activities of federal agencies having jurisdiction in such matters to avoid unnecessary duplication;(11) To present state concerns and interests to other states, regional organizations, and the federal government on the location, construction, and operation of any energy facility which may affect the environment, health, or safety of the citizens of the state of Washington;(12) To issue permits in compliance with applicable provisions of the federally approved state implementation plan adopted in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act, as now existing or hereafter amended, for the new construction, reconstruction, or enlargement or operation of energy facilities: PROVIDED, That such permits shall become effective only if the ((governor))council approves an application for certification and executes a certification agreement pursuant to this chapter: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That all such permits be conditioned upon compliance with all provisions of the federally approved state implementation plan which apply to energy facilities covered within the provisions of this chapter; and(13) To serve as an interagency coordinating body for energy-related issues.Sec. 3. RCW 80.50.045 and 2023 c 229 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The council shall consult with other state agencies, utilities, local municipal governments, public interest groups, tribes, and other interested persons to convey their views to the secretary and the federal energy regulatory commission regarding appropriate limits on federal regulatory authority in the siting of electrical transmission corridors in the state of Washington.(2) The council is designated as the state authority for purposes of siting transmission facilities under Title 16 U.S.C.

RCW 80.80.040 and 2011 c 180 s 103 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Beginning July 1, 2008, the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard for all baseload electric generation for which electric utilities enter into long-term financial commitments on or after such date is the lower of:(a) One thousand one hundred pounds of greenhouse gases per megawatt-hour; or(b) The average available greenhouse gas emissions output as determined under RCW 80.80.050.(2) This chapter does not apply to long-term financial commitments with the Bonneville power administration.(3)(a) Except as provided in (c) of this subsection, all baseload electric generation facilities in operation as of June 30, 2008, are deemed to be in compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard established under this section until the facilities are the subject of long-term financial commitments.(b) All baseload electric generation that commences operation after June 30, 2008, and is located in Washington, must comply with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard established in subsection (1) of this section.(c)(i) A coal-fired baseload electric generation facility in Washington that emitted more than ((one million))1,000,000 tons of greenhouse gases in any calendar year prior to 2008 must comply with the lower of the following greenhouse gas emissions performance standard such that one generating boiler is in compliance by December 31, 2020, and any other generating boiler is in compliance by December 31, 2025:(A) One thousand one hundred pounds of greenhouse gases per megawatt-hour; or(B) The average available greenhouse gas emissions output as determined under RCW 80.80.050.(ii) This subsection (3)(c) does not apply to a coal-fired baseload electric ((generating [generation]))generation facility in the event the department determines as a requirement of state or federal law or regulation that selective catalytic reduction technology must be installed on any of its boilers.(4) All electric generation facilities or power plants powered exclusively by renewable resources, as defined in RCW 19.280.020, are deemed to be in compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard established under this section.(5) All cogeneration facilities in the state that are fueled by natural gas or waste gas or a combination of the two fuels, and that are in operation as of June 30, 2008, are deemed to be in compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard established under this section until the facilities are the subject of a new ownership interest or are upgraded.(6) In determining the rate of emissions of greenhouse gases for baseload electric generation, the total emissions associated with producing electricity shall be included.(7) In no case shall a long-term financial commitment be determined to be in compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard if the commitment includes more than ((twelve))12 percent of electricity from unspecified sources.(8) For a long-term financial commitment with multiple power plants, each specified power plant must be treated individually for the purpose of determining the annualized plant capacity factor and net emissions, and each power plant must comply with subsection (1) of this section, except as provided in subsections (3) through (5) of this section.(9) The department shall establish an output-based methodology to ensure that the calculation of emissions of greenhouse gases for a cogeneration facility recognizes the total usable energy output of the process, and includes all greenhouse gases emitted by the facility in the production of both electrical and thermal energy. In developing and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department shall consider and act in a manner consistent with any rules adopted pursuant to the public utilities regulatory policy act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 824a-3), as amended.(10) The following greenhouse gas emissions produced by baseload electric generation owned or contracted through a long-term financial commitment shall not be counted as emissions of the power plant in determining compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard:(a) Those emissions that are injected permanently in geological formations;(b) Those emissions that are permanently sequestered by other means approved by the department; and(c) Those emissions sequestered or mitigated as approved under subsection (16) of this section.(11) In adopting and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department of commerce energy policy division, in consultation with the commission, the department, the Bonneville power administration, the western electricity coordinating council, the energy facility site evaluation council, electric utilities, public interest representatives, and consumer representatives, shall consider the effects of the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard on system reliability and overall costs to electricity customers.(12) In developing and implementing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department shall, with assistance of the commission, the department of commerce energy policy division, and electric utilities, and to the extent practicable, address long-term purchases of electricity from unspecified sources in a manner consistent with this chapter.(13) The directors of the energy facility site evaluation council and the department shall each adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW in coordination with each other to implement and enforce the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard. The rules necessary to implement this section shall be adopted by June 30, 2008.(14) In adopting the rules for implementing this section, the energy facility site evaluation council and the department shall include criteria to be applied in evaluating the carbon sequestration plan, for baseload electric generation that will rely on subsection (10) of this section to demonstrate compliance, but that will commence sequestration after the date that electricity is first produced. The rules shall include but not be limited to:(a) Provisions for financial assurances, as a condition of plant operation, sufficient to ensure successful implementation of the carbon sequestration plan, including construction and operation of necessary equipment, and any other significant costs;(b) Provisions for geological or other approved sequestration commencing within five years of plant operation, including full and sufficient technical documentation to support the planned sequestration;(c) Provisions for monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation of the sequestration plan;(d) Penalties for failure to achieve implementation of the plan on schedule;(e) Provisions for an owner to purchase emissions reductions in the event of the failure of a sequestration plan under subsection (16) of this section; and(f) Provisions for public notice and comment on the carbon sequestration plan.(15)(a) Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, as part of its role enforcing the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard, the department shall determine whether sequestration or a plan for sequestration will provide safe, reliable, and permanent protection against the greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere from the power plant and all ancillary facilities.(b) For facilities under its jurisdiction, the energy facility site evaluation council shall contract for review of sequestration or the carbon sequestration plan with the department consistent with the conditions under (a) of this subsection, consider the adequacy of sequestration or the plan in its adjudicative proceedings conducted under RCW 80.50.090(((3)))(4), and incorporate specific findings regarding adequacy ((in its recommendation to the governor under RCW 80.50.100)).(16) A project under consideration by the energy facility site evaluation council by July 22, 2007, is required to include all of the requirements of subsection (14) of this section in its carbon sequestration plan submitted as part of the energy facility site evaluation council process. A project under consideration by the energy facility site evaluation council by July 22, 2007, that receives final site certification agreement approval under chapter 80.50 RCW shall make a good faith effort to implement the sequestration plan. If the project owner determines that implementation is not feasible, the project owner shall submit documentation of that determination to the energy facility site evaluation council. The documentation shall demonstrate the steps taken to implement the sequestration plan and evidence of the technological and economic barriers to successful implementation. The project owner shall then provide to the energy facility site evaluation council notification that they shall implement the plan that requires the project owner to meet the greenhouse gas emissions performance standard by purchasing verifiable greenhouse gas emissions reductions from an electric generation facility located within the western interconnection, where the reduction would not have occurred otherwise or absent this contractual agreement, such that the sum of the emissions reductions purchased and the facility's emissions meets the standard for the life of the facility.Sec. 14. RCW 90.48.262 and 1975-'76 2nd ex.s. c 108 s 41 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The powers established under RCW 90.48.260 shall be implemented by the department through the adoption of rules in every appropriate situation. The permit program authorized under RCW 90.48.260(1)(a) shall constitute a continuation of the established permit program of RCW 90.48.160 and other applicable sections within chapter 90.48 RCW. The appropriate modifications as authorized in ((this))chapter 155, Laws of 1973 ((amendatory act)) are designed to avoid duplication and other wasteful practices and to insure that the state permit program contains all required elements of and is compatible with the requirements of any national permit system.(2) Permits for energy facilities subject to chapter 80.50 RCW shall be issued by the energy facility site evaluation council: PROVIDED, That such permits shall become effective only if the ((governor))council approves an application for certification and executes a certification agreement pursuant to said chapter. The council shall have all powers necessary to establish and administer a point source discharge permit program pertaining to such plants, consistent with applicable receiving water quality standards established by the department, and to qualify for full participation in any national waste discharge or pollution discharge elimination permit system. The council and the department shall each adopt, by rules, procedures which will provide maximum coordination and avoid duplication between the two agencies with respect to permits in carrying out the requirements of ((this act))chapter 155, Laws of 1973 including, but not limited to, monitoring and enforcement of certification agreements, and in qualifying for full participation in any such national system.Sec. 15. RCW 90.58.140 and 2019 c 225 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:(1) A development shall not be undertaken on the shorelines of the state unless it is consistent with the policy of this chapter and, after adoption or approval, as appropriate, the applicable guidelines, rules, or master program.(2) A substantial development shall not be undertaken on shorelines of the state without first obtaining a permit from the government entity having administrative jurisdiction under this chapter.A permit shall be granted:(a) From June 1, 1971, until such time as an applicable master program has become effective, only when the development proposed is consistent with: (i) The policy of RCW 90.58.020; and (ii) after their adoption, the guidelines and rules of the department; and (iii) so far as can be ascertained, the master program being developed for the area;(b) After adoption or approval, as appropriate, by the department of an applicable master program, only when the development proposed is consistent with the applicable master program and this chapter.(3) The local government shall establish a program, consistent with rules adopted by the department, for the administration and enforcement of the permit system provided in this section. The administration of the system so established shall be performed exclusively by the local government.(4) Except as otherwise specifically provided in subsection (11) of this section, the local government shall require notification of the public of all applications for permits governed by any permit system established pursuant to subsection (3) of this section by ensuring that notice of the application is given by at least one of the following methods:(a) Mailing of the notice to the latest recorded real property owners as shown by the records of the county assessor within at least ((three hundred))300 feet of the boundary of the property upon which the substantial development is proposed;(b) Posting of the notice in a conspicuous manner on the property upon which the project is to be constructed; or(c) Any other manner deemed appropriate by local authorities to accomplish the objectives of reasonable notice to adjacent landowners and the public.The notices shall include a statement that any person desiring to submit written comments concerning an application, or desiring to receive notification of the final decision concerning an application as expeditiously as possible after the issuance of the decision, may submit the comments or requests for decisions to the local government within ((thirty))30 days of the last date the notice is to be published pursuant to this subsection. The local government shall forward, in a timely manner following the issuance of a decision, a copy of the decision to each person who submits a request for the decision.If a hearing is to be held on an application, notices of such a hearing shall include a statement that any person may submit oral or written comments on an application at the hearing.(5) The system shall include provisions to assure that construction pursuant to a permit will not begin or be authorized until ((twenty-one))21 days from the date the permit decision was filed as provided in subsection (6) of this section; or until all review proceedings are terminated if the proceedings were initiated within ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing as defined in subsection (6) of this section except as follows:(a) In the case of any permit issued to the state of Washington, department of transportation, for the construction and modification of SR 90 (I-90) on or adjacent to Lake Washington, the construction may begin after thirty days from the date of filing, and the permits are valid until December 31, 1995;(b)(i) In the case of any permit or decision to issue any permit to the state of Washington, department of transportation, for the replacement of the floating bridge and landings of the state route number 520 Evergreen Point bridge on or adjacent to Lake Washington, the construction may begin ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing. Any substantial development permit granted for the floating bridge and landings is deemed to have been granted on the date that the local government's decision to grant the permit is issued. This authorization to construct is limited to only those elements of the floating bridge and landings that do not preclude the department of transportation's selection of a four-lane alternative for state route number 520 between Interstate 5 and Medina. Additionally, the Washington state department of transportation shall not engage in or contract for any construction on any portion of state route number 520 between Interstate 5 and the western landing of the floating bridge until the legislature has authorized the imposition of tolls on the Interstate 90 floating bridge and/or other funding sufficient to complete construction of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program. For the purposes of this subsection (5)(b), the "western landing of the floating bridge" means the least amount of new construction necessary to connect the new floating bridge to the existing state route number 520 and anchor the west end of the new floating bridge;(ii) Nothing in this subsection (5)(b) precludes the shorelines hearings board from concluding that the project or any element of the project is inconsistent with the goals and policies of the shoreline management act or the local shoreline master program;(iii) This subsection (5)(b) applies retroactively to any appeals filed after January 1, 2012, and to any appeals filed on or after March 23, 2012, and expires June 30, 2014;(c)(i) In the case of permits for projects addressing significant public safety risks, as defined by the department of transportation, it is not in the public interest to delay construction until all review proceedings are terminated. In the case of any permit issued under this chapter or decision to issue any permit under this chapter for a transportation project of the Washington state department of transportation, construction may begin ((twenty-one))21 days after the date of filing if all components of the project achieve a no net loss of shoreline ecological functions, as defined by department guidelines adopted pursuant to RCW 90.58.060 and as determined through the following process:(A) The department of transportation, as part of the permit review process, must provide the local government with an assessment of how the project affects shoreline ecological functions. The assessment must include specific actions for avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts to shoreline ecological functions, developed in consultation with the department, that ensure there is no net loss of shoreline ecological functions; and(B) The local government, after reviewing the assessment required in (c)(i)(A) of this subsection and prior to the final issuance of all appropriate shoreline permits and variances, must determine that the project will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.(ii) Nothing in this subsection (5)(c) precludes the shorelines hearings board from concluding that the shoreline project or any element of the project is inconsistent with this chapter, the local shoreline master program, chapter 43.21C RCW and its implementing regulations, or the applicable shoreline regulations.(iii) This subsection (5)(c) does not apply to permit decisions for the replacement of the floating bridge and landings of the state route number 520 Evergreen Point bridge on or adjacent to Lake Washington;(d) Except as authorized in (b) and (c) of this subsection, construction may be commenced no sooner than ((thirty))30 days after the date of the appeal of the board's decision is filed if a permit is granted by the local government and (i) the granting of the permit is appealed to the shorelines hearings board within ((twenty-one))21 days of the date of filing, (ii) the hearings board approves the granting of the permit by the local government or approves a portion of the substantial development for which the local government issued the permit, and (iii) an appeal for judicial review of the hearings board decision is filed pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. The appellant may request, within ((ten))10 days of the filing of the appeal with the court, a hearing before the court to determine whether construction pursuant to the permit approved by the hearings board or to a revised permit issued pursuant to the order of the hearings board should not commence. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court finds that construction pursuant to such a permit would involve a significant, irreversible damaging of the environment, the court shall prohibit the permittee from commencing the construction pursuant to the approved or revised permit until all review proceedings are final. Construction pursuant to a permit revised at the direction of the hearings board may begin only on that portion of the substantial development for which the local government had originally issued the permit, and construction pursuant to such a revised permit on other portions of the substantial development may not begin until after all review proceedings are terminated. In such a hearing before the court, the burden of proving whether the construction may involve significant irreversible damage to the environment and demonstrating whether such construction would or would not be appropriate is on the appellant;(e) Except as authorized in (b) and (c) of this subsection, if the permit is for a substantial development meeting the requirements of subsection (11) of this section, construction pursuant to that permit may not begin or be authorized until ((twenty-one))21 days from the date the permit decision was filed as provided in subsection (6) of this section.If a permittee begins construction pursuant to (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this subsection, the construction is begun at the permittee's own risk. If, as a result of judicial review, the courts order the removal of any portion of the construction or the restoration of any portion of the environment involved or require the alteration of any portion of a substantial development constructed pursuant to a permit, the permittee is barred from recovering damages or costs involved in adhering to such requirements from the local government that granted the permit, the hearings board, or any appellant or intervener.(6) Any decision on an application for a permit under the authority of this section, whether it is an approval or a denial, shall, concurrently with the transmittal of the ruling to the applicant, be filed with the department and the attorney general. This shall be accomplished by return receipt requested mail. A petition for review of such a decision must be commenced within ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing of the decision.(a) With regard to a permit other than a permit governed by subsection (10) of this section, "date of filing" as used in this section refers to the date of actual receipt by the department of the local government's decision.(b) With regard to a permit for a variance or a conditional use governed by subsection (10) of this section, "date of filing" means the date the decision of the department is transmitted by the department to the local government.(c) When a local government simultaneously transmits to the department its decision on a shoreline substantial development with its approval of either a shoreline conditional use permit or variance, or both, "date of filing" has the same meaning as defined in (b) of this subsection.(d) The department shall notify in writing the local government and the applicant of the date of filing by telephone or electronic means, followed by written communication as necessary, to ensure that the applicant has received the full written decision.(7) Applicants for permits under this section have the burden of proving that a proposed substantial development is consistent with the criteria that must be met before a permit is granted. In any review of the granting or denial of an application for a permit as provided in RCW 90.58.180 (1) and (2), the person requesting the review has the burden of proof.(8) Any permit may, after a hearing with adequate notice to the permittee and the public, be rescinded by the issuing authority upon the finding that a permittee has not complied with conditions of a permit. If the department is of the opinion that noncompliance exists, the department shall provide written notice to the local government and the permittee. If the department is of the opinion that the noncompliance continues to exist ((thirty))30 days after the date of the notice, and the local government has taken no action to rescind the permit, the department may petition the hearings board for a rescission of the permit upon written notice of the petition to the local government and the permittee if the request by the department is made to the hearings board within ((fifteen))15 days of the termination of the ((thirty-day))30-day notice to the local government.(9) The holder of a certification ((from the governor)) pursuant to chapter 80.50 RCW shall not be required to obtain a permit under this section.(10) Any permit for a variance or a conditional use issued with approval by a local government under their approved master program must be submitted to the department for its approval or disapproval.(11)(a) An application for a substantial development permit for a limited utility extension or for the construction of a bulkhead or other measures to protect a single-family residence and its appurtenant structures from shoreline erosion shall be subject to the following procedures:(i) The public comment period under subsection (4) of this section shall be ((twenty))20 days. The notice provided under subsection (4) of this section shall state the manner in which the public may obtain a copy of the local government decision on the application no later than two days following its issuance;(ii) The local government shall issue its decision to grant or deny the permit within ((twenty-one))21 days of the last day of the comment period specified in (a)(i) of this subsection; and(iii) If there is an appeal of the decision to grant or deny the permit to the local government legislative authority, the appeal shall be finally determined by the legislative authority within thirty days.(b) For purposes of this section, a limited utility extension means the extension of a utility service that:(i) Is categorically exempt under chapter 43.21C RCW for one or more of the following: Natural gas, electricity, telephone, water, or sewer;(ii) Will serve an existing use in compliance with this chapter; and(iii) Will not extend more than ((twenty-five hundred))2,500 linear feet within the shorelines of the state.(12) A permit under this section is not required in order to dispose of dredged materials at a disposal site approved through the cooperative planning process referenced in RCW 79.105.500, provided the dredged material disposal proponent obtains a valid site use authorization from the dredged material management program office within the department of natural resources.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 16.

ï»¿S-0004.2SENATE BILL 5015State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Boehnke, Chapman, Christian, Dozier, Fortunato, Harris, Short, Wagoner, and J. WilsonPrefiled 12/05/24.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology.AN ACT Relating to increasing efficiency at the energy facility site evaluation council by removing the governor from the project approval process; amending RCW 80.50.040, 80.50.045, 80.50.060, 80.50.071, 80.50.090, 80.50.100, 80.50.105, 80.50.130, 80.50.330, 70A.15.3130, 80.70.020, 80.80.040, 90.48.262, and 90.58.140; creating a new section; and repealing RCW 80.50.320.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that the energy facility site evaluation process culminates in a recommendation to the governor as the final step in the process. The legislature determines that the site evaluation process would be improved if the council were authorized to make the final decision without the necessity of making a recommendation to the governor. The council is the primary decision maker in the site evaluation process, having reviewed and considered all evidence, reports, comments, and submissions by the parties and participants in an adjudicative proceeding. With respect to the office of the governor, the governor's role in the process, apart from appointing the chair of the council, is not a critical piece of the overall project review, and the efficiency and speediness of the site evaluation process would be streamlined by making the council the final decision maker on the projects it reviews.Sec. 2. RCW 80.50.040 and 2022 c 183 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:The council shall have the following powers:(1) To adopt, promulgate, amend, or rescind suitable rules and regulations, pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW, to carry out the provisions of this chapter, and the policies and practices of the council in connection therewith;(2) To develop and apply environmental and ecological guidelines in relation to the type, design, location, construction, initial operational conditions of certification, and ongoing regulatory oversight under the regulatory authority established in this chapter of energy facilities subject to this chapter;(3) To establish rules of practice for the conduct of public hearings pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, as found in chapter 34.05 RCW;(4) To prescribe the form, content, and necessary supporting documentation for site certification;(5) To receive applications for energy facility locations and to investigate the sufficiency thereof;(6) To enter into contracts to carry out the provisions of this chapter;(7) To conduct hearings on the proposed location and operational conditions of the energy facilities under the regulatory authority established in this chapter;(8) To prepare written reports ((to the governor)) which shall include: (a) A statement indicating whether the application is in compliance with the council's guidelines, (b) criteria specific to the site and transmission line routing, (c) a council ((recommendation))decision as to the disposition of the application, and (d) a ((draft)) certification agreement when the council ((recommends approval of))approves the application;(9) To prescribe the means for monitoring of the effects arising from the construction and the operation of energy facilities to assure continued compliance with terms of certification and/or permits issued by the council pursuant to chapter 90.48 RCW or subsection (12) of this section: PROVIDED, That any on-site inspection required by the council shall be performed by other state agencies pursuant to interagency agreement: PROVIDED FURTHER, That the council may retain authority for determining compliance relative to monitoring;(10) To integrate its site evaluation activity with activities of federal agencies having jurisdiction in such matters to avoid unnecessary duplication;(11) To present state concerns and interests to other states, regional organizations, and the federal government on the location, construction, and operation of any energy facility which may affect the environment, health, or safety of the citizens of the state of Washington;(12) To issue permits in compliance with applicable provisions of the federally approved state implementation plan adopted in accordance with the Federal Clean Air Act, as now existing or hereafter amended, for the new construction, reconstruction, or enlargement or operation of energy facilities: PROVIDED, That such permits shall become effective only if the ((governor))council approves an application for certification and executes a certification agreement pursuant to this chapter: AND PROVIDED FURTHER, That all such permits be conditioned upon compliance with all provisions of the federally approved state implementation plan which apply to energy facilities covered within the provisions of this chapter; and(13) To serve as an interagency coordinating body for energy-related issues.Sec. 3. RCW 80.50.045 and 2023 c 229 s 5 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The council shall consult with other state agencies, utilities, local municipal governments, public interest groups, tribes, and other interested persons to convey their views to the secretary and the federal energy regulatory commission regarding appropriate limits on federal regulatory authority in the siting of electrical transmission corridors in the state of Washington.(2) The council is designated as the state authority for purposes of siting transmission facilities under Title 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824p and for purposes of other such rules or regulations adopted by the secretary. The council's authority regarding transmission facilities under this subsection is limited to those transmission facilities that are the subject of Title 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824p and this chapter.(3) For the construction and modification of transmission facilities that are the subject of Title 16 U.S.C. Sec. 824p, the council may: (a) Approve the siting of the facilities; and (b) consider the interstate benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of the facilities in the state.(4) When ((developing recommendations as to the disposition of))reviewing an application for the construction or modification of transmission facilities under this chapter, the fuel source of the electricity carried by the transmission facilities shall not be considered.(5) For electrical transmission projects proposed or sited by a federal agency, the director must coordinate state agency participation in environmental review under the national environmental policy act.Sec. 4. RCW 80.50.060 and 2023 c 229 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:(1)(a) The provisions of this chapter apply to the construction of energy facilities which includes the new construction of energy facilities and the reconstruction or enlargement of existing energy facilities where the net increase in physical capacity or dimensions resulting from such reconstruction or enlargement meets or exceeds those capacities or dimensions set forth in RCW 80.50.020 (14) and (29).

The council shall have all powers necessary to establish and administer a point source discharge permit program pertaining to such plants, consistent with applicable receiving water quality standards established by the department, and to qualify for full participation in any national waste discharge or pollution discharge elimination permit system. The council and the department shall each adopt, by rules, procedures which will provide maximum coordination and avoid duplication between the two agencies with respect to permits in carrying out the requirements of ((this act))chapter 155, Laws of 1973 including, but not limited to, monitoring and enforcement of certification agreements, and in qualifying for full participation in any such national system.Sec. 15. RCW 90.58.140 and 2019 c 225 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:(1) A development shall not be undertaken on the shorelines of the state unless it is consistent with the policy of this chapter and, after adoption or approval, as appropriate, the applicable guidelines, rules, or master program.(2) A substantial development shall not be undertaken on shorelines of the state without first obtaining a permit from the government entity having administrative jurisdiction under this chapter.A permit shall be granted:(a) From June 1, 1971, until such time as an applicable master program has become effective, only when the development proposed is consistent with: (i) The policy of RCW 90.58.020; and (ii) after their adoption, the guidelines and rules of the department; and (iii) so far as can be ascertained, the master program being developed for the area;(b) After adoption or approval, as appropriate, by the department of an applicable master program, only when the development proposed is consistent with the applicable master program and this chapter.(3) The local government shall establish a program, consistent with rules adopted by the department, for the administration and enforcement of the permit system provided in this section. The administration of the system so established shall be performed exclusively by the local government.(4) Except as otherwise specifically provided in subsection (11) of this section, the local government shall require notification of the public of all applications for permits governed by any permit system established pursuant to subsection (3) of this section by ensuring that notice of the application is given by at least one of the following methods:(a) Mailing of the notice to the latest recorded real property owners as shown by the records of the county assessor within at least ((three hundred))300 feet of the boundary of the property upon which the substantial development is proposed;(b) Posting of the notice in a conspicuous manner on the property upon which the project is to be constructed; or(c) Any other manner deemed appropriate by local authorities to accomplish the objectives of reasonable notice to adjacent landowners and the public.The notices shall include a statement that any person desiring to submit written comments concerning an application, or desiring to receive notification of the final decision concerning an application as expeditiously as possible after the issuance of the decision, may submit the comments or requests for decisions to the local government within ((thirty))30 days of the last date the notice is to be published pursuant to this subsection. The local government shall forward, in a timely manner following the issuance of a decision, a copy of the decision to each person who submits a request for the decision.If a hearing is to be held on an application, notices of such a hearing shall include a statement that any person may submit oral or written comments on an application at the hearing.(5) The system shall include provisions to assure that construction pursuant to a permit will not begin or be authorized until ((twenty-one))21 days from the date the permit decision was filed as provided in subsection (6) of this section; or until all review proceedings are terminated if the proceedings were initiated within ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing as defined in subsection (6) of this section except as follows:(a) In the case of any permit issued to the state of Washington, department of transportation, for the construction and modification of SR 90 (I-90) on or adjacent to Lake Washington, the construction may begin after thirty days from the date of filing, and the permits are valid until December 31, 1995;(b)(i) In the case of any permit or decision to issue any permit to the state of Washington, department of transportation, for the replacement of the floating bridge and landings of the state route number 520 Evergreen Point bridge on or adjacent to Lake Washington, the construction may begin ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing. Any substantial development permit granted for the floating bridge and landings is deemed to have been granted on the date that the local government's decision to grant the permit is issued. This authorization to construct is limited to only those elements of the floating bridge and landings that do not preclude the department of transportation's selection of a four-lane alternative for state route number 520 between Interstate 5 and Medina. Additionally, the Washington state department of transportation shall not engage in or contract for any construction on any portion of state route number 520 between Interstate 5 and the western landing of the floating bridge until the legislature has authorized the imposition of tolls on the Interstate 90 floating bridge and/or other funding sufficient to complete construction of the state route number 520 bridge replacement and HOV program. For the purposes of this subsection (5)(b), the "western landing of the floating bridge" means the least amount of new construction necessary to connect the new floating bridge to the existing state route number 520 and anchor the west end of the new floating bridge;(ii) Nothing in this subsection (5)(b) precludes the shorelines hearings board from concluding that the project or any element of the project is inconsistent with the goals and policies of the shoreline management act or the local shoreline master program;(iii) This subsection (5)(b) applies retroactively to any appeals filed after January 1, 2012, and to any appeals filed on or after March 23, 2012, and expires June 30, 2014;(c)(i) In the case of permits for projects addressing significant public safety risks, as defined by the department of transportation, it is not in the public interest to delay construction until all review proceedings are terminated. In the case of any permit issued under this chapter or decision to issue any permit under this chapter for a transportation project of the Washington state department of transportation, construction may begin ((twenty-one))21 days after the date of filing if all components of the project achieve a no net loss of shoreline ecological functions, as defined by department guidelines adopted pursuant to RCW 90.58.060 and as determined through the following process:(A) The department of transportation, as part of the permit review process, must provide the local government with an assessment of how the project affects shoreline ecological functions. The assessment must include specific actions for avoiding, minimizing, and mitigating impacts to shoreline ecological functions, developed in consultation with the department, that ensure there is no net loss of shoreline ecological functions; and(B) The local government, after reviewing the assessment required in (c)(i)(A) of this subsection and prior to the final issuance of all appropriate shoreline permits and variances, must determine that the project will result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.(ii) Nothing in this subsection (5)(c) precludes the shorelines hearings board from concluding that the shoreline project or any element of the project is inconsistent with this chapter, the local shoreline master program, chapter 43.21C RCW and its implementing regulations, or the applicable shoreline regulations.(iii) This subsection (5)(c) does not apply to permit decisions for the replacement of the floating bridge and landings of the state route number 520 Evergreen Point bridge on or adjacent to Lake Washington;(d) Except as authorized in (b) and (c) of this subsection, construction may be commenced no sooner than ((thirty))30 days after the date of the appeal of the board's decision is filed if a permit is granted by the local government and (i) the granting of the permit is appealed to the shorelines hearings board within ((twenty-one))21 days of the date of filing, (ii) the hearings board approves the granting of the permit by the local government or approves a portion of the substantial development for which the local government issued the permit, and (iii) an appeal for judicial review of the hearings board decision is filed pursuant to chapter 34.05 RCW. The appellant may request, within ((ten))10 days of the filing of the appeal with the court, a hearing before the court to determine whether construction pursuant to the permit approved by the hearings board or to a revised permit issued pursuant to the order of the hearings board should not commence. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court finds that construction pursuant to such a permit would involve a significant, irreversible damaging of the environment, the court shall prohibit the permittee from commencing the construction pursuant to the approved or revised permit until all review proceedings are final. Construction pursuant to a permit revised at the direction of the hearings board may begin only on that portion of the substantial development for which the local government had originally issued the permit, and construction pursuant to such a revised permit on other portions of the substantial development may not begin until after all review proceedings are terminated. In such a hearing before the court, the burden of proving whether the construction may involve significant irreversible damage to the environment and demonstrating whether such construction would or would not be appropriate is on the appellant;(e) Except as authorized in (b) and (c) of this subsection, if the permit is for a substantial development meeting the requirements of subsection (11) of this section, construction pursuant to that permit may not begin or be authorized until ((twenty-one))21 days from the date the permit decision was filed as provided in subsection (6) of this section.If a permittee begins construction pursuant to (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this subsection, the construction is begun at the permittee's own risk. If, as a result of judicial review, the courts order the removal of any portion of the construction or the restoration of any portion of the environment involved or require the alteration of any portion of a substantial development constructed pursuant to a permit, the permittee is barred from recovering damages or costs involved in adhering to such requirements from the local government that granted the permit, the hearings board, or any appellant or intervener.(6) Any decision on an application for a permit under the authority of this section, whether it is an approval or a denial, shall, concurrently with the transmittal of the ruling to the applicant, be filed with the department and the attorney general. This shall be accomplished by return receipt requested mail. A petition for review of such a decision must be commenced within ((twenty-one))21 days from the date of filing of the decision.(a) With regard to a permit other than a permit governed by subsection (10) of this section, "date of filing" as used in this section refers to the date of actual receipt by the department of the local government's decision.(b) With regard to a permit for a variance or a conditional use governed by subsection (10) of this section, "date of filing" means the date the decision of the department is transmitted by the department to the local government.(c) When a local government simultaneously transmits to the department its decision on a shoreline substantial development with its approval of either a shoreline conditional use permit or variance, or both, "date of filing" has the same meaning as defined in (b) of this subsection.(d) The department shall notify in writing the local government and the applicant of the date of filing by telephone or electronic means, followed by written communication as necessary, to ensure that the applicant has received the full written decision.(7) Applicants for permits under this section have the burden of proving that a proposed substantial development is consistent with the criteria that must be met before a permit is granted. In any review of the granting or denial of an application for a permit as provided in RCW 90.58.180 (1) and (2), the person requesting the review has the burden of proof.(8) Any permit may, after a hearing with adequate notice to the permittee and the public, be rescinded by the issuing authority upon the finding that a permittee has not complied with conditions of a permit. If the department is of the opinion that noncompliance exists, the department shall provide written notice to the local government and the permittee. If the department is of the opinion that the noncompliance continues to exist ((thirty))30 days after the date of the notice, and the local government has taken no action to rescind the permit, the department may petition the hearings board for a rescission of the permit upon written notice of the petition to the local government and the permittee if the request by the department is made to the hearings board within ((fifteen))15 days of the termination of the ((thirty-day))30-day notice to the local government.(9) The holder of a certification ((from the governor)) pursuant to chapter 80.50 RCW shall not be required to obtain a permit under this section.(10) Any permit for a variance or a conditional use issued with approval by a local government under their approved master program must be submitted to the department for its approval or disapproval.(11)(a) An application for a substantial development permit for a limited utility extension or for the construction of a bulkhead or other measures to protect a single-family residence and its appurtenant structures from shoreline erosion shall be subject to the following procedures:(i) The public comment period under subsection (4) of this section shall be ((twenty))20 days. The notice provided under subsection (4) of this section shall state the manner in which the public may obtain a copy of the local government decision on the application no later than two days following its issuance;(ii) The local government shall issue its decision to grant or deny the permit within ((twenty-one))21 days of the last day of the comment period specified in (a)(i) of this subsection; and(iii) If there is an appeal of the decision to grant or deny the permit to the local government legislative authority, the appeal shall be finally determined by the legislative authority within thirty days.(b) For purposes of this section, a limited utility extension means the extension of a utility service that:(i) Is categorically exempt under chapter 43.21C RCW for one or more of the following: Natural gas, electricity, telephone, water, or sewer;(ii) Will serve an existing use in compliance with this chapter; and(iii) Will not extend more than ((twenty-five hundred))2,500 linear feet within the shorelines of the state.(12) A permit under this section is not required in order to dispose of dredged materials at a disposal site approved through the cooperative planning process referenced in RCW 79.105.500, provided the dredged material disposal proponent obtains a valid site use authorization from the dredged material management program office within the department of natural resources.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 16.
