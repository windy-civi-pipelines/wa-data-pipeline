The legislature determines that the site evaluation process would be improved if the council were authorized to make the final decision without the necessity of making a recommendation to the governor. The council is the primary decision maker in the site evaluation process, having reviewed and considered all evidence, reports, comments, and submissions by the parties and participants in an adjudicative proceeding. With respect to the office of the governor, the governor's role in the process, apart from appointing the chair of the council, is not a critical piece of the overall project review, and the efficiency and speediness of the site evaluation process would be streamlined by making the council the final decision maker on the projects it reviews.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div
