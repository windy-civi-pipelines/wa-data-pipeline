This is a reappropriation of funds appropriated in the 2023-2025 fiscal biennium. The study should generate volume estimates and evaluate scenarios for changes in infrastructure and operations that would be necessary to address those additional volumes. The assessment must include quantitative analysis based on available data in terms of both financial and carbon emission costs; and qualitative input gathered from tribal governments, local governments, freight interests, and other key stakeholders, including impacts on disadvantaged/underserved communities. The analysis must include a robust public engagement process to solicit feedback from interested stakeholders including but not limited to: Residents and officials in affected cities and counties; stakeholders involved in railroad, agriculture, fishing, trucking, shipping and other related industries; appropriate Native American tribes; representatives of advocacy and community organizations; and transportation, public works, and economic development organizations in the affected areas, federal highway administration and army corps of engineers.
