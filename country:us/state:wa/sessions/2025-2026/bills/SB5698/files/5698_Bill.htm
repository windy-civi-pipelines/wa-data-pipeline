If a municipal gas utility elects to pursue the alternative emission reduction pathway under this section, the department must adopt an emergency rule to adjust the allowance budget of the program applicable to years 2026 and beyond.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) A municipal gas utility electing to pursue the alternative emission reduction pathway authorized under this section must submit written notice to the department by September 1, 2025, informing the department of its intent to elect the alternative emission reduction pathway. This notice must be accompanied by a plan that meets the requirements of subsection (3) of this section. If the department reviews the plan and determines that it meets the requirements of subsection (3) of this section, the department must notify the utility that its plan has been approved, and the municipal gas utility is relieved of its compliance obligation as of December 31, 2025.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) An alternative emission reduction pathway proposed by a municipal gas utility must:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Be designed to reduce the covered emissions of the municipal gas utility below 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 and each year thereafter;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) At minimum, result in the targeted expenditure, on emission reduction activities under the plan, by the municipal gas utility of funds that equal or exceed the funds that would have been expended by the municipal gas utility to satisfy its compliance obligation under this chapter each year through 2030; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Describe the activities that the municipal gas utility will pursue to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to below 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, and demonstrate, including detailed assumptions, how the activities will result in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and each year thereafter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4)(a) In the event that a municipal gas utility implementing an alternative emission reduction pathway fails to achieve emission reductions sufficient to drop the utility's emissions below 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, the utility shall revert to being a covered entity for purposes of the third compliance period. Because data allowing for the department to determine whether the utility's alternative emission reduction pathway plan may not be available until midway through the third compliance period, the department must allow the utility to submit all compliance instruments to satisfy its compliance obligation during the third compliance period in the final year of the third compliance period. However, a utility whose alternative emission reduction pathway plan fails to achieve its 2030 target must also submit penalty compliance instruments in an amount equal to one compliance instrument for each ton of emissions that were not covered by the program during the years 2026 through 2030.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) In the event that a municipal gas utility implementing an alternative emission reduction pathway has covered emissions during any year after 2030 that exceed 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, the municipal gas utility must become a covered entity effective as of the year its emissions exceeded 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. A utility electing an alternative emission reduction pathway whose covered emissions exceeds 22,500 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in any year after 2030 must also submit penalty compliance instruments in an amount equal to one compliance instrument for each ton of emissions that were not covered by the program during the years 2026 through the year that the utility resumed a compliance obligation under this chapter as a covered entity.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.080'>70A.65.080</a> and 2024 c 352 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A person is a covered entity as of the beginning of the first compliance period and all subsequent compliance periods if the person reported emissions under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.2200'>70A.15.2200</a> for any calendar year from 2015 through 2019, or if additional data provided as required by this chapter indicates that emissions for any calendar year from 2015 through 2019 equaled or exceeded any of the following thresholds, or if the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer and imports electricity into the state during the compliance period:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Where the person owns or operates a facility and the facility's emissions equal or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Where the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer and generates electricity in the state and emissions associated with this generation equals or exceeds 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c)(i) Where the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer importing electricity into the state and:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) For specified sources, the cumulative annual total of emissions associated with the imported electricity exceeds 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) For unspecified sources, the cumulative annual total of emissions associated with the imported electricity exceeds 0 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;

The customer benefits provided from allowances consigned to auction under this section must be in addition to existing requirements in statute, rule, or other legal requirements.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Except for low-income customers, the customer bill credits under this subsection are reserved exclusively for customers at locations connected to a natural gas utility's system on July 25, 2021.

The reports must be complete and contain all information required by 40 C.F.R. Sec. 98.406 including, but not limited to, information on large end users served by the natural gas utility. For any year where a natural gas utility was not required to file this report with the United States environmental protection agency, a report may be submitted in a manner prescribed by the department containing all of the information required in the subpart NN report.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) To continue receiving no cost allowances, a natural gas utility must provide to the department the United States environmental protection agency subpart NN greenhouse gas emissions report for each reporting year in the manner and by the dates provided by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.2200'>70A.15.2200</a>(5) as part of the greenhouse gas reporting requirements of this chapter.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
