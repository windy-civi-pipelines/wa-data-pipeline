These exemptions and preferences result in the entire tax system being less fair for people who do not have special exemptions and preferences and increase the taxes on all other taxpayers in order to fund education and other state services.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Tax exemptions reduce revenues collected from the tax base and provide preferential treatment to some at the expense of those not getting a tax exemption. Almost as much money as is collected in tax revenues is not collected and is given out as tax exemptions. While every expenditure of revenue must be authorized and appropriated in the state budget approved by the legislature, the massive amounts of funding for these tax preferences and exemptions continue without any readoption by the legislature in each budget. These exemptions and preferences are, therefore, tax expenditures, most of which continue without any legislative action year after year while the state seeks other funding to meet constitutional duties to fund education and other services and obligations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Off-budget spending in the form of tax expenditures has resulted in out-of-control state spending that is depleting the state of needed revenue to fund essential state services like education and health care. Tax expenditures as off-budget spending lack the accountability of other state spending programs because they have not been included in the state biennial budget process and are not subject to the same biennial scrutiny.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) This act creates a discretionary tax expenditure budget as part of the biennial budget adopted by the legislature. This act reforms the tax expenditure process by including a discretionary tax expenditure budget in the biennial state budget process. This act is intended to improve transparency and accountability by requiring that those tax preferences that have no expiration date in law or have been recommended for review and clarification: Receive a review, clarification, performance measures, and expiration date; are readopted every two years as part of the budget process; or expire. This brings tax expenditures into the state budget process to protect the public's interest, makes them more transparent and accountable, and helps ensure the tax expenditures are producing the results intended when they were adopted by the legislature. The legislature finds that it has not acted to review and clarify or terminate most tax preferences that the joint legislative audit and review committee have recommended for review and clarification or termination by the legislature. It is the legislature's intent to add weight to such findings and recommendations by recognizing that these are tax expenditures and requiring those discretionary preferences to be reviewed and clarified, terminated, or readopted in the biennial budget if they are to be continued.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.88'>43.88</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The omnibus operating appropriations act enacted by the legislature must include a discretionary tax expenditure budget detailing all discretionary tax expenditures.
