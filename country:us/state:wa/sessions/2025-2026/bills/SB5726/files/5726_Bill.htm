Transportation funding needs are currently met through a variety of revenue-generating funding mechanisms, including fuel taxes, vehicle licensing fees, and other registration fees. While the fuel tax bears a relationship to use of the roadways, it also varies based on the fuel economy of a vehicle. The legislature believes that a more direct road usage-based funding method would more fairly and accurately correspond to motor vehicle use of public roads. The legislature also recognizes that the state's roadways are part of the state's integrated transportation system, and that all elements of the transportation system are necessary to sustain the system as a whole and to foster mobility throughout the state.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds that a fair and equitable means of funding the statewide transportation system in the long term is needed to serve the transportation needs of the state. As vehicles become more fuel efficient and this impacts state fuel tax revenue, which has historically funded the construction, preservation, maintenance, and operations of the state highway system and the state ferry system, a reliable source of 18th amendment protected funds is needed to offset reductions in fuel tax revenue. At the same time, the legislature recognizes that support for a range of transportation modes can help mitigate the demands placed on the roadway system and that establishing a source of transportation revenue to support these modes can further the longstanding and growing need for an additional revenue source to help offset demands on a heavily utilized state highway system by funding critical rail, bicycle, pedestrian, and public transportation needs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) It is, therefore, the legislature's intent to establish a road usage licensing fee for preservation and maintenance highway purposes that imposes a per mile fee for the use of public roads and that is phased in over time using a rate to maintain the same net level of revenue as the fuel tax rate generates today. It is also the legislature's intent to establish a road use assessment on the use of public roadways that can be collected alongside a road usage fee to, in combination, provide support to all elements of the state's transportation system, thereby ensuring that the system is able to meet the demands being placed upon it.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature further finds and declares that the road usage charge system must protect individuals' privacy and civil liberties. Experience in states that collect road usage charges, in addition to the research and year long test of road usage charging in Washington, demonstrates that mileage-based charges can be implemented in a manner that ensures data security and protects the privacy of motor vehicle owners. The legislature intends that the road usage charge system authorized in this act be designed and implemented in a manner that places privacy of the motor vehicle owner as a first principle, especially with regard to location data.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1)(a) A voluntary road usage charge program is established that places a per mile fee on motor vehicle usage of public roadways in the state.
