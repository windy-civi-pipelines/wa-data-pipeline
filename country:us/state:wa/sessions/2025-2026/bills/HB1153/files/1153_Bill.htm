ï»¿H-0349.1HOUSE BILL 1153State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Duerr, Ramel, Parshley, Berg, Ormsby, and HillPrefiled 01/03/25.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources.AN ACT Relating to urban forest management ordinances; amending RCW 76.15.010 and 76.15.110; and creating new sections.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that there is currently a shortage of housing, particularly affordable housing, within the state. The legislature finds one of the most efficient and sustainable ways to address this shortage is through the development of housing options within existing urban growth areas. The legislature also finds that tree canopy and green space are necessary for the health and wellness of urban growth area residents, and that the retention of the most significant and vital trees in a community is a valuable goal. To improve the quality of tree canopy and green space in the state, the legislature previously adopted chapter 76.15 RCW to encourage planning for, planting, maintaining, and managing trees in the state's cities, counties, and tribal lands.Local government policies, programs, activities, and management plans regarding urban and community forestry may, however, limit or prevent development opportunities that would provide needed additional housing. The legislature believes it is important that actions taken by local governments to promote urban and community forestry and to address the negative impacts of a reduction in tree canopy do not adversely impact the ability of local governments to provide housing that is needed to accommodate projected population growth. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to provide guidance to local governments wishing to create tree bank programs as an additional tool for promoting urban and community forestry while also allowing for the development of needed housing. Tree banks can allow the removal of trees in one area being developed to be offset by the addition of trees to one or more areas in which the need for trees is more acute. Using tree banks can facilitate adding trees in areas that have historically suffered from environmental inequality and health disparities, areas subject to the urban heat island effect, and areas in which the trees will most benefit salmon and orca recovery efforts.At the same time, the legislature recognizes that the retention of critical trees is of even more benefit than is the use of tree banks. The legislature believes that local regulations can ensure that the most vital trees within a community are protected, even while providing developers with the ability to produce needed housing options. Through the use of incentives for preserving the trees that are most critical to maintaining a healthy urban tree canopy, local governments can encourage developers to maintain trees without disincentivizing or preventing the construction of housing. The legislature intends to encourage and assist local governments in the use of such regulations.It is the intent of the legislature that the department of natural resources produce model regulations incorporating tree banks and development incentives for the protection of vital trees for use by local governments. It is also the intent of the legislature that these model regulations be voluntary and that local governments retain discretion in choosing whether to adopt the regulations.Sec. 2. RCW 76.15.010 and 2021 c 209 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Department" means the department of natural resources.(2) "Evergreen community" means a city, town, or county designated as such under RCW 76.15.090.(3) "Highly impacted community" has the same meaning as defined in RCW 19.405.020 or an equivalent cumulative impacts analysis that identifies the environmental health conditions of communities as a factor of both environmental health hazards and vulnerable populations as defined in RCW 19.405.020.(4) "Management plan" means an urban forest management plan developed pursuant to this chapter.(5) "Tree bank" means an area or areas designated by a community wherein trees can be planted to compensate for the removal of trees elsewhere, and includes programs providing for the payment of a fee in lieu of physically planting the trees.(6) "Tree canopy" means the layer of leaves, branches, and stems of trees that cover the ground when viewed from above and that can be measured as a percentage of a land area shaded by trees.(((6)))(7) "Tribes" means any federally recognized Indian tribes whose traditional lands and territories include parts of the state.(((7)))(8) "Urban and community forest" or "urban forest" is that land in and around human settlements ranging from small communities to metropolitan areas, occupied or potentially occupied by trees and associated vegetation.
