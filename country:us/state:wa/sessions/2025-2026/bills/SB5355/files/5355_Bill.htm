While college campuses have been working in this area, this approach has not been fully realized yet, and sex-based violence and harassment remain a major barrier for students working to achieve their educational goals.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that, according to the rape, abuse, and incest national network, postsecondary students are at high risk for sex-based violence and harassment; among undergraduate and graduate students, 13 percent experience sexual assault or rape during their postsecondary schooling years. Undergraduate women in particular experience even higher rates, with more than one in four experiencing sexual assault or rape.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature acknowledges that postsecondary students lack adequate protections against sex-based violence and harassment as well as avenues for justice, and that survivors need access to more relevant, timely, and sensitive resources. Although the state has invested in student safety on campus, the ongoing rates of sex-based violence and harassment demand the legislature's action and attention to protect students and ensure they are able to successfully achieve their potential.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to provide survivors at postsecondary institutions with certain protections, resources, and accommodations to help them navigate the aftermath of traumatic sex-based and gender-based violence and harassment.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) In addition to all other rights provided in law, a student at an institution of higher education in Washington who is a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment has the right to:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(a) Engage with employees who have been trained in trauma-informed care. Institutions of higher education must clearly list on their website the campus-based employees trained in trauma-informed care. The employees are responsible for responding to survivor disclosures. Title IX employees at each institution of higher education who may interact with a survivor of sex-based violence and harassment must receive at least three hours of training on relationship violence, abuse dynamics, impacts of trauma on the body, and other forms of violence. The institution of higher education must provide the training in accordance with section 4 of this act;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A quick and timely institutional investigation process not to exceed six months from the date an investigation is initiated, unless extenuating circumstances exist.

A campus-affiliated advocate trained in trauma-informed care, consistent with the current standards for initial and continuing education training of domestic violence program staff, must be available within two business days of a report being made to the Title IX office or campus-based advocacy office. Survivors must have the option to be accompanied by a campus-affiliated advocate or peer advocate trained in trauma-informed care, while engaged in seeking support services or reporting concerns to an institution of higher education related to sex-based or gender-based violence and harassment.
