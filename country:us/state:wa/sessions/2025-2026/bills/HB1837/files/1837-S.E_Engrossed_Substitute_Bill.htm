The legislature finds that intercity passenger rail is a highly efficient mode of transportation that connects small towns and major urban centers, and that the improvement of intercity passenger rail service through improvements to trip times, frequency, and reliability can enhance local economies and increase mobility options for Washington residents. Therefore, the legislature intends to reemphasize the need to prioritize the improvement of intercity passenger rail through data-driven analyses as it conducts project development work, including for the federal corridor identification and development program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The department shall prioritize the target goals in this subsection for the Amtrak Cascades service, with a goal of meeting them by 2035. The legislature recognizes that voluntary investments by the government of Canada, crown corporations, provincial entities, and Oregon state entities, will be required to achieve these target goals outside of Washington state borders.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Service reliability: Increase on-time performance with a minimum trip reliability goal of 88 percent on-time performance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Service frequencies: A minimum of 14 round trips per day between Seattle and Portland and a minimum of five round trips per day between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Speeds: Incrementally increase speeds to shorten travel times, with a target of reaching two hour and 45 minute trip times between Seattle and Portland and three hour and 20 minute trip times between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. The department shall engage with host railroads and infrastructure owners on increasing speeds beyond current maximum operating speeds and, if necessary, identify the additional infrastructure that would be needed to reach trip time targets.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Improvements to first and last mile connections: Create improved multimodal connectivity to other transportation options at stations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Emission reductions: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with state goals.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The department is required to prioritize the target goals set in subsection (2) of this section as it conducts project development work, including for the federal corridor identification and development program and for work that may be done in the future as part of the federal-state partnership for intercity passenger rail grant program. Project development work carried out by the department must include infrastructure investments and extensive coordination with host railroads, and other service partners, as necessary to achieve these target goals.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4)(a) The department shall report to the transportation committees of the legislature, as well as to the joint transportation committee, annually on analyses conducted and progress made to achieve the target goals in subsection (2) of this section, including any information required to be disclosed under this subsection (4).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b)(i) If the department finds that one or more of the target goals set in subsection (2) of this section cannot be achieved due to a constraint unless it is mitigated by the legislature or another party, it must provide a full explanation of the constraint and detail what is necessary to mitigate it as part of the annual reporting requirement under (a) of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the department finds that one or more of the target goals set in subsection (2) of this section cannot be achieved due to a constraint that cannot be mitigated, even with assistance from the legislature or another party, it must provide a detailed explanation of the reasons it believes a target goal should be modified, either temporarily or for the indefinite future, to accommodate the identified unavoidable constraint as part of the annual reporting requirement under (a) of this subsection.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
