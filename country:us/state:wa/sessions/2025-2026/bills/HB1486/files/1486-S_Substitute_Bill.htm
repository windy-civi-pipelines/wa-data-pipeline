Specifically, students serve on the governing boards of systems of community and technical colleges in over 10 other states. Students also serve as voting members on both the Washington student achievement council and the workforce education investment accountability and oversight board. These opportunities have provided students the opportunity to contribute greatly to deliberations where they have been able to share ideas and concerns on decisions that directly impact students.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that student perspectives offer the opportunity to bring the state board for community and technical colleges closer to the student community that it serves. Being on campus and in class every day, students are exposed directly to many topics of interest to the board, which is important for comprehensive and in-depth discussion. Moreover, student populations at community and technical colleges are the most diverse of any institution of higher education in the state, and thus the student member would be exposed to a more diverse group than any other member of the board representing any one group of the community.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Additionally, the legislature acknowledges that student positions on governing boards are also a valuable tool for developing leadership through experiential learning. Student members learn processes of institutional governance, analyze policy proposals, and participate in board discussions and decision making.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to enhance community college governance by the state board of community and technical colleges through fostering a stronger relationship with students in policy development and decision making at the state level.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50.050'>28B.50.050</a> and 1991 c 238 s 30 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(1)</span> There is hereby created the "state board for community and technical colleges", to consist of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">nine</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10</span> members who represent the geographic diversity of the state, and who shall be appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate.
