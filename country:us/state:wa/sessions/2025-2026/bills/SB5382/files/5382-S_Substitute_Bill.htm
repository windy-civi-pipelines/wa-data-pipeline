The legislature determines that this right must be further guarded against fraud and mistake.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature has previously found that "paying a worker, whose task it is to secure the signatures of voters on initiative or referendum petitions, on the basis of the number of signatures the worker secures on the petitions encourages the introduction of fraud in the signature gathering process. Such a form of payment may act as an incentive for the worker to encourage a person to sign a petition which the person is not qualified to sign or to sign a petition for a ballot measure even if the person has already signed a petition for the measure." RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.84.280'>29A.84.280</a>. Despite this finding, paid signature gathering has proliferated in Washington state and is routinely used by ballot measure proponents to qualify initiatives and referenda.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petitions to include a statement that the petition signature gatherer swears or affirms under penalty of law that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge, every petitioner signed their true name, correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, and was not compensated or promised compensation for signing the petition. These circulator declarations regularly go unsigned, leaving no record of the paid worker or other person who circulated the petition and was responsible for gathering the signatures contained therein. To adequately guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake, the legislature determines that the law must be clarified to require each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition to sign the declaration under penalty of false swearing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The requirement for the petition circulator to sign such a declaration aligns with similar requirements in many other states in fact, a majority of states that have a ballot measure process require similar signed declarations. This requirement promotes the accuracy and integrity of information furnished on petition sheets and enables meaningful enforcement of existing law addressing petition misconduct and other crimes in chapters  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.44'>9.44</a> and  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.84'>29A.84</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature further finds that an election official verifying that the petitioner's residence address on the petition or paper is the same as the residence address on the affidavit of registration will also guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake. Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petition sheets to include a place for each petitioner to sign and print his or her name, and the address, city, and county at which he or she is registered to vote. However, in 2023, numerous petition signatures on initiatives to the legislature were validated by the secretary of state that were not accompanied by the petitioner's address, city, and county of registration. Without the petitioner's residence address, the secretary of state validated petition signatures by relying on an apparent match between a signature on the petition sheet and a signature associated with a voter registration record, identified through a one-to-many comparison. The requirement for verification of the petitioner's address aligns with similar requirements in several other states, including Idaho and California. Verifying that the petitioner's residence address on an initiative or referendum petition is the same as the residence address on the petitioner's affidavit of voter registration will improve the accuracy of signature matching by reducing the number of potential comparators and confirming that an apparent signature match is correct. This verification will ensure that validated signatures are from registered voters who are qualified to sign petitions. The requirement reduces the risk that signatures from persons who are not qualified to sign will be incorrectly attributed to a qualified registered voter and that duplicate signatures from the same person will be counted more than once.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72'>29A.72</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition must sign the declaration contained on each sheet of the petition as prescribed in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.110'>29A.72.110</a>(1)(b),  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.120'>29A.72.120</a>(1)(b), or  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.130'>29A.72.130</a>(1)(b).</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.110'>29A.72.110</a> and 2005 c 239 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(1)</span> Petitions for proposing measures for submission to the legislature at its next regular session must be substantially in the following form:</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(a)</span> The warning prescribed by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.140'>29A.72.140</a>; followed by:</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">INITIATIVE PETITION FOR SUBMISSION TO THE LEGISLATURE</div><div style="text-indent:-25px;padding-left:25px;margin-top:4.5pt;">To the Honorable .Â .Â .Â .Â .Â ., Secretary of State of the State of Washington:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">We, the undersigned citizens and legal voters of the State of Washington, respectfully direct that this petition and the proposed measure known as Initiative Measure No. .Â .Â .Â . and entitled (here set forth the established ballot title of the measure), a full, true, and correct copy of which is printed on the reverse side of this petition, be transmitted to the legislature of the State of Washington at its next ensuing regular session, and we respectfully petition the legislature to enact said proposed measure into law; and each of us for himself or herself says: I have personally signed this petition; I am a legal voter of the State of Washington in the city (or town) and county written after my name, my residence address is correctly stated, and I have knowingly signed this petition only once.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(b)</span> The following declaration must be printed on the reverse side of the petition:</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">I, . . . . . . . . . . . ., swear or affirm under penalty of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">law</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">false swearing</span> that I circulated this sheet of the foregoing petition, and that, to the best of my knowledge, every person who signed this sheet of the foregoing petition <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reviewed the sheet and</span> knowingly and without any compensation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or gratuity</span> or promise of compensation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or gratuity</span> willingly signed his or her true name and that the information provided therewith is true and correct.
