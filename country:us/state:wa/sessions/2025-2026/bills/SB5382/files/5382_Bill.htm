ï»¿S-0595.2SENATE BILL 5382State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Valdez, Liias, Nobles, SaldaÃ±a, and C. WilsonRead first time 01/21/25.Referred to Committee on State Government, Tribal Affairs & Elections.AN ACT Relating to requirements pertaining to signatures and addresses of ballot measure petitioners and petition signature gatherers; amending RCW 29A.72.110, 29A.72.120, and 29A.72.130; adding new sections to chapter 29A.72 RCW; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. A new section is added to chapter 29A.72 RCW to read as follows:The legislature recognizes that the people have reserved for themselves the power to enact or reject legislation through the initiative and referendum process, as provided in Article II, section 1 of the state Constitution. The legislature determines that this right must be further guarded against fraud and mistake. Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petitions to include a statement that the petition signature gatherer swears or affirms under penalty of law that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge, every petitioner signed their true name, correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, and was not compensated or promised compensation for signing the petition. To adequately guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake, the legislature determines that the law must be clarified to require each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition to sign the declaration under penalty of false swearing. The requirement for the petition circulator to sign such a declaration aligns with similar requirements in many other states in fact, a majority of states that have a ballot measure process require similar signed declarations. The legislature further finds that an election official verifying that the petitioner's residence address on the petition or paper is the same as the residence address on the affidavit of registration will also guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 29A.72 RCW to read as follows:Each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition must sign a declaration contained on each sheet of the petition affirming, under penalty of false swearing, that every petitioner signing that sheet correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, that the petitioner was eligible to sign the petition and reviewed the sheet, and that the petitioner was not compensated or given gratuity or promised compensation or gratuity for signing the petition.Sec. 3.
