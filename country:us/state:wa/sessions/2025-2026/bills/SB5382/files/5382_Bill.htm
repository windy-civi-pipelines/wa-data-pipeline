The legislature determines that this right must be further guarded against fraud and mistake. Currently, the law requires initiative and referendum petitions to include a statement that the petition signature gatherer swears or affirms under penalty of law that, to the best of the circulator's knowledge, every petitioner signed their true name, correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, and was not compensated or promised compensation for signing the petition. To adequately guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake, the legislature determines that the law must be clarified to require each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition to sign the declaration under penalty of false swearing. The requirement for the petition circulator to sign such a declaration aligns with similar requirements in many other states in fact, a majority of states that have a ballot measure process require similar signed declarations. The legislature further finds that an election official verifying that the petitioner's residence address on the petition or paper is the same as the residence address on the affidavit of registration will also guard the people's initiative and referendum right against fraud and mistake.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72'>29A.72</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Each petition signature gatherer circulating an initiative or referendum petition must sign a declaration contained on each sheet of the petition affirming, under penalty of false swearing, that every petitioner signing that sheet correctly provided the accompanying information on the signature sheet, that the petitioner was eligible to sign the petition and reviewed the sheet, and that the petitioner was not compensated or given gratuity or promised compensation or gratuity for signing the petition.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.110'>29A.72.110</a> and 2005 c 239 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Petitions for proposing measures for submission to the legislature at its next regular session must be substantially in the following form:</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">The warning prescribed by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.72.140'>29A.72.140</a>; followed by:</div><div style="text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;">INITIATIVE PETITION FOR SUBMISSION TO THE LEGISLATURE</div><div style="text-indent:-25px;padding-left:25px;margin-top:4.5pt;">To the Honorable .Â .Â .Â .Â .Â ., Secretary of State of the State of Washington:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">We, the undersigned citizens and legal voters of the State of Washington, respectfully direct that this petition and the proposed measure known as Initiative Measure No. .Â .Â .Â . and entitled (here set forth the established ballot title of the measure), a full, true, and correct copy of which is printed on the reverse side of this petition, be transmitted to the legislature of the State of Washington at its next ensuing regular session, and we respectfully petition the legislature to enact said proposed measure into law; and each of us for himself or herself says: I have personally signed this petition; I am a legal voter of the State of Washington in the city (or town) and county written after my name, my residence address is correctly stated, and I have knowingly signed this petition only once.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The following declaration must be printed on the reverse side of the petition:</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">I, . . . . . . . . . . . ., swear or affirm under penalty of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">law</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">false swearing</span> that I circulated this sheet of the foregoing petition, and that, to the best of my knowledge, every person who signed this sheet of the foregoing petition <span style="text-decoration:underline;">reviewed the sheet and</span> knowingly and without any compensation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or gratuity</span> or promise of compensation <span style="text-decoration:underline;">or gratuity</span> willingly signed his or her true name and that the information provided therewith is true and correct.
