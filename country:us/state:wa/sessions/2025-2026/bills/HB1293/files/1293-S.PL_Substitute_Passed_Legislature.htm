Improperly disposing of trash poses significant risks to public health, our environment, and the economy.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature also finds that single-use plastic bags are one of the most commonly found items that litter state roads, beaches, and other public spaces. Plastic bag litter is known to harm animals, particularly aquatic species, and contributes to the proliferation of microplastics, which pose significant threats to human health. Encouraging the adoption of alternatives to plastic bags, such as reusable carryout bags, reduces plastic waste. While thicker plastic bags may be more durable and reusable, initial research has demonstrated that many customers may still use them as single-use bags, and consequently, thicker plastic bags contribute to more plastic waste.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature also finds that when specifically tailored, penalties and fees act as effective deterrents to harmful behaviors, such as littering, and can lead to the adoption of more sustainable practices.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to discourage littering and the proliferation of plastic waste by enhancing penalties for littering, delaying requirements relating to increasing the thickness of reusable plastic bags, and imposing new penalties for the sale of thicker plastic bags. The legislature also intends to direct the fees collected from the new penalties to the waste reduction, recycling, and litter control account to address the negative impacts of litter.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.200.060'>70A.200.060</a> and 2024 c 231 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It is a violation of this section to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Abandon a junk vehicle upon any property;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Throw, drop, deposit, discard, or otherwise dispose of litter upon any public property in the state or upon private property in this state not owned by him or her or in the waters of this state whether from a vehicle or otherwise including but not limited to any public highway, public park, beach, campground, forestland, recreational area, trailer park, highway, road, street, or alley except:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) When the property is designated by the state or its agencies or political subdivisions for the disposal of garbage and refuse, and the person is authorized to use such property for that purpose;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Into a litter receptacle in a manner that will prevent litter from being carried away or deposited by the elements upon any part of the private or public property or waters.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) Except as provided in subsection (5) of this section, it is a class ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">3</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">2</span> civil infraction as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.80.120'>7.80.120</a> for a person to litter in an amount less than or equal to one cubic foot. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">This penalty is in addition to any penalty imposed for a violation of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.645'>46.61.645</a>(1).</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) It is a misdemeanor for a person to litter in an amount greater than one cubic foot but less than 10 cubic yards.
