Following the corrective action, the department may withdraw the self-insurer's certification under RCW 51.14.080 based on an assessment of whether the self-insurer has complied with the terms of the corrective action or is likely to commit future violations of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.(b) If a self-insurer who has previously been subject to a corrective action under (a) of this subsection subsequently commits two or more violations within a two-year period, requiring a corrective action under (a) of this subsection, and such action would occur within 10 years of completing a prior corrective action and probationary period under this subsection, the department must withdraw the self-insurer's certification under RCW 51.14.080.(c) For purposes of determining the timing of violations for the requirements in this subsection, the director must use the date of the department's order.
