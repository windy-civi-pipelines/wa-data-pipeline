There are few options for mattress recycling in Washington.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Mattresses are bulky products that are difficult to handle, on average weighing 55 pounds and taking up about one cubic yard of landfill space, they float to the surface of landfills and are challenging to manage at transfer stations. They are illegally dumped along our roadways and in remote locations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) There are economic benefits to increasing mattress recycling. Most mattress recyclers use manual labor to dismantle a mattress, which involves cutting it open, separating the components, and bailing them to then be recycled by other commodity recyclers into useful products elsewhere. Increasing the number of mattresses recycled will increase recycling jobs and reduce the environmental and economic costs of landfilling and illegal dumping.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) There are environmental benefits to increasing mattress recycling, which captures useful materials such as metal, foam, wood, and cotton for recycling, and reduces climate emissions associated with production of new materials and avoids their placement in landfills.
