Prior to the time for posting the notices, the board must appoint for each precinct, from the electors thereof, one inspector and two judges, who shall constitute a board of election for the precinct. If the board fails to appoint a board of election, or the members appointed do not attend at the opening of the polls on the morning of election, the electors of the precinct present at that hour may appoint the board, or supply the place of an absent member thereof. The board of directors must, in its order appointing the board of election, designate the house or place within the precinct where the election must be held. However, in any irrigation district that is less than ((two hundred thousand))200,000 acres in size and is divided into director divisions, the board of directors in its discretion may designate one polling place within the district to serve more than one election precinct. The board of directors of any irrigation district may designate the principal business office of the district as a polling place to serve one or more election precincts and may do so regardless of whether the business office is located within or outside of the boundaries of the district. If the board of directors does designate a single polling place for more than one election precinct, then the election officials appointed by the board of directors may serve more than one election precinct and the election officials may be electors of any of the election precincts for which they are the election board.(2)(a) The following additional notice requirements apply to districts that qualify and have designated their own treasurer as provided in RCW 87.03.440:(i) The district must annually notify qualified electors, either by mail, electronic communication, or by posting on the district's website, of the following:(A) The names of the board of directors and dates their terms expire;(B) The method and deadline for declaring candidacy under RCW 87.03.075; and(C) A description of the district voting procedure and how the qualified elector may request an absentee ballot, if the district is not using the mail-in ballot procedure.(ii) The district will use its assessment roll, toll and charge roll, or other district records to provide notice to known qualified electors and may also use the county assessor's or other public records to assist in determining qualified electors.(iii) A district that makes water deliveries to an entity which is responsible for paying assessments or tolls and charges and that entity subsequently distributes that water to lands within the entity's jurisdiction is only required to provide the annual notice to the entity paying the assessment or toll and charge.(iv) Any person who becomes a qualified elector after the annual notice required by this section and before a subsequent election is eligible to vote in the election. Receiving or not receiving the annual notice provided in this section does not affect whether the person or entity is a qualified elector.(b) Each district must establish and maintain election information on a website, either individually or through the Washington state water resources association, in order to communicate with qualified electors. The website must include, but is not limited to, the names of the board of directors, district election rules provided in this chapter, information on elections including election results, and contact information for the district.Sec. 9. RCW 87.03.105 and 1889-90 p 676 s 9 are each amended to read as follows:No list, tally paper or certificate returned from any election shall be set aside or rejected for want of form, if it can be satisfactorily understood. The board of directors must meet at its usual place of meeting on the ((first Monday))second Wednesday after each election, to canvass the returns. If, at the time of meeting, the returns from each precinct in the district in which the polls were opened have been received, the board of directors must then and there proceed to canvass the returns, but if all the returns have not been received, the canvass must be postponed from day to day until all the returns have been received, or until six postponements have been had. The canvass must be made in public, and by opening the returns and estimating the vote of the district for each person voted for, and declaring the result thereof. If an undeclared write-in candidate for a position of director receives the most votes, the board of directors must determine whether that candidate is a qualified elector for that specific position. A qualified elector for the position of director must be 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, a resident of the division of the district for which the director is being elected, or the designated agent of an entity that owns land within that division. If that candidate is not a qualified elector, the qualified elector receiving the next highest number of votes will be deemed elected to the position.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 10. A new section is added to chapter 87.03 RCW to read as follows:The following election security requirements apply to districts that qualify and have designated their own treasurer as provided in RCW 87.03.440:(1) At all times when ballots are being controlled including, but not limited to, receipt, opening of ballots, certification, tabulation, reconciliation, or any other type of processing, two individuals not on the ballot must be present.(2)(a) Each ballot box must be secured and locked, with a deposit slot, and clearly marked as an "official ballot box."

No ballots on any form other than the official form shall be received or counted.In any election for directors where the number of votes which may be received will have no bearing on the length of the term to be served, the candidates for the position of director((, in lieu of filing a declaration of candidacy hereunder, shall file with the secretary of the district))shall file with the secretary of the district a declaration of their candidacy by submitting a petition of nomination, on a form prescribed by the district, signed by at least ten qualified electors of the district, or of the division if the district has been divided into director divisions, not later than five o'clock p.m. on the first Monday in ((November))October.

The procedure set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to any other irrigation district elections.Sec. 8. RCW 87.03.085 and 1987 c 123 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Fifteen days before any election held under this chapter, subsequent to the organization of any district, the secretary of the board of directors shall cause notices to be posted in three public places in each election precinct, of the time and place of holding the election. The secretary shall also post a general notice of the same in the office of the board, which shall be established and kept at some fixed place to be determined by the board, specifying the polling places of each precinct. Prior to the time for posting the notices, the board must appoint for each precinct, from the electors thereof, one inspector and two judges, who shall constitute a board of election for the precinct. If the board fails to appoint a board of election, or the members appointed do not attend at the opening of the polls on the morning of election, the electors of the precinct present at that hour may appoint the board, or supply the place of an absent member thereof. The board of directors must, in its order appointing the board of election, designate the house or place within the precinct where the election must be held. However, in any irrigation district that is less than ((two hundred thousand))200,000 acres in size and is divided into director divisions, the board of directors in its discretion may designate one polling place within the district to serve more than one election precinct. The board of directors of any irrigation district may designate the principal business office of the district as a polling place to serve one or more election precincts and may do so regardless of whether the business office is located within or outside of the boundaries of the district. If the board of directors does designate a single polling place for more than one election precinct, then the election officials appointed by the board of directors may serve more than one election precinct and the election officials may be electors of any of the election precincts for which they are the election board.(2)(a) The following additional notice requirements apply to districts that qualify and have designated their own treasurer as provided in RCW 87.03.440:(i) The district must annually notify qualified electors, either by mail, electronic communication, or by posting on the district's website, of the following:(A) The names of the board of directors and dates their terms expire;(B) The method and deadline for declaring candidacy under RCW 87.03.075; and(C) A description of the district voting procedure and how the qualified elector may request an absentee ballot, if the district is not using the mail-in ballot procedure.(ii) The district will use its assessment roll, toll and charge roll, or other district records to provide notice to known qualified electors and may also use the county assessor's or other public records to assist in determining qualified electors.(iii) A district that makes water deliveries to an entity which is responsible for paying assessments or tolls and charges and that entity subsequently distributes that water to lands within the entity's jurisdiction is only required to provide the annual notice to the entity paying the assessment or toll and charge.(iv) Any person who becomes a qualified elector after the annual notice required by this section and before a subsequent election is eligible to vote in the election. Receiving or not receiving the annual notice provided in this section does not affect whether the person or entity is a qualified elector.(b) Each district must establish and maintain election information on a website, either individually or through the Washington state water resources association, in order to communicate with qualified electors. The website must include, but is not limited to, the names of the board of directors, district election rules provided in this chapter, information on elections including election results, and contact information for the district.Sec. 9. RCW 87.03.105 and 1889-90 p 676 s 9 are each amended to read as follows:No list, tally paper or certificate returned from any election shall be set aside or rejected for want of form, if it can be satisfactorily understood. The board of directors must meet at its usual place of meeting on the ((first Monday))second Wednesday after each election, to canvass the returns. If, at the time of meeting, the returns from each precinct in the district in which the polls were opened have been received, the board of directors must then and there proceed to canvass the returns, but if all the returns have not been received, the canvass must be postponed from day to day until all the returns have been received, or until six postponements have been had. The canvass must be made in public, and by opening the returns and estimating the vote of the district for each person voted for, and declaring the result thereof. If an undeclared write-in candidate for a position of director receives the most votes, the board of directors must determine whether that candidate is a qualified elector for that specific position. A qualified elector for the position of director must be 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, a resident of the division of the district for which the director is being elected, or the designated agent of an entity that owns land within that division. If that candidate is not a qualified elector, the qualified elector receiving the next highest number of votes will be deemed elected to the position.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 10.
