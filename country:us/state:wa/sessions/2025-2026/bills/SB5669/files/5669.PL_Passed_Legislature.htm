The board of directors must meet at its usual place of meeting on the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">first Monday</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">second Wednesday</span> after each election, to canvass the returns. If, at the time of meeting, the returns from each precinct in the district in which the polls were opened have been received, the board of directors must then and there proceed to canvass the returns, but if all the returns have not been received, the canvass must be postponed from day to day until all the returns have been received, or until six postponements have been had. The canvass must be made in public, and by opening the returns and estimating the vote of the district for each person voted for, and declaring the result thereof. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If an undeclared write-in candidate for a position of director receives the most votes, the board of directors must determine whether that candidate is a qualified elector for that specific position. A qualified elector for the position of director must be 18 years of age, a citizen of the United States, a resident of the division of the district for which the director is being elected, or the designated agent of an entity that owns land within that division. If that candidate is not a qualified elector, the qualified elector receiving the next highest number of votes will be deemed elected to the position.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 10.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=87.03'>87.03</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The following election security requirements apply to districts that qualify and have designated their own treasurer as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=87.03.440'>87.03.440</a>:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) At all times when ballots are being controlled including, but not limited to, receipt, opening of ballots, certification, tabulation, reconciliation, or any other type of processing, two individuals not on the ballot must be present.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) Each ballot box must be secured and locked, with a deposit slot, and clearly marked as an "official ballot box."
