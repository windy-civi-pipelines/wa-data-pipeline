Furthermore, the legislature recognizes proportional representation encourages greater school board diversity, and more parents of school-aged children to seek office than at-large district elections. Therefore, the legislature intends to require school districts with enrollments greater than 3,000 students to elect school board directors from designated member districts.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.343'>28A.343</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By calendar year 2027, all elections of directors of any school district with a head count enrollment greater than 3,000 students shall elect school board directors from designated member districts accordingly:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) For districts with a head count enrollment greater than 5,000 students, no less than four school board directors shall be elected by designated member districts; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) For districts with a head count enrollment of 3,001 to 5,000 students, no less than three school board directors shall be elected by designated member districts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) School districts with 3,000 students or less are exempt from this section.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.343.300'>28A.343.300</a> and 2009 c 107 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The governing board of a school district shall be known as the board of directors of the district.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Unless otherwise specifically provided, as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=29A.04.340'>29A.04.340</a> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and section 2 of this act</span>, each member of a board of directors shall be elected by ballot by the registered voters of the school district and shall hold office for a term of four years and until a successor is elected and qualified.
