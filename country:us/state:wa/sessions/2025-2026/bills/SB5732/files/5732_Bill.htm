In 2023, the department of commerce estimated that Washington will need more than a million new homes over the next 20 years to keep pace with expected population growth. Other analyses, such as the William D. Ruckelshaus Center's "Pathways to Housing Security" final report, recommend that Washington should improve coordination in the various sectors of the housing system to carry out long-term strategies that will confront the daunting housing challenge.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that the growth management act provides for enforceable accountability measures, growth management hearings board review, and other sanctions that may be used to ensure the goals of the act are accomplished. By adapting these accountability mechanisms to include a greater emphasis on housing supply, the legislature concludes that the growth management act can become a better tool for encouraging counties and cities to plan for more housing to be built.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature therefore determines that the following specific policies will increase the likelihood that Washington will make progress toward meeting the housing goals of the growth management act and enhance the ability of Washington residents of all income levels to secure housing that meets their needs:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Direct counties to foster land use patterns that will provide an abundant supply of housing in rural areas;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Specify that the housing and permit goals of the growth management act require closing the housing availability gap while continuously tracking progress toward increasing housing supply, including by monitoring and tracking permit applications to ensure that the housing goal is being measured and will be achieved;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Clarify that counties and cities planning under the growth management act must ensure that their comprehensive plans and development regulations provide sufficient land to accommodate new housing developments;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Require countywide planning policies to monitor and track progress toward permitting new housing to address housing crises at a regional level; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Provide for sanctions when a county or city fails to track or make progress on increasing housing supply pursuant to the housing goal of the growth management act.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.011'>36.70A.011</a> and 2002 c 212 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that this chapter is intended to recognize the importance of rural lands and rural character to Washington's economy, its people, and its environment, while respecting regional differences. Rural lands and rural-based economies enhance the economic desirability of the state, help to preserve traditional economic activities, and contribute to the state's overall quality of life.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that to retain and enhance the job base in rural areas, rural counties must have flexibility to create opportunities for business development <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and housing</span>. Further, the legislature finds that rural counties must have the flexibility to retain existing businesses and allow them to expand. The legislature recognizes that not all business developments in rural counties require an urban level of services; and that many businesses in rural areas fit within the definition of rural character identified by the local planning unit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Finally, the legislature finds that in defining its rural element under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.070'>36.70A.070</a>(5), a county should foster land use patterns and develop a local vision of rural character that will: Help preserve rural-based economies and traditional rural lifestyles; encourage the economic prosperity of rural residents; foster opportunities for small-scale, rural-based employment and self-employment; permit the operation of rural-based agricultural, commercial, recreational, and tourist businesses that are consistent with existing and planned land use patterns; be compatible with the use of the land by wildlife and for fish and wildlife habitat; foster the private stewardship of the land and preservation of open space; <span style="text-decoration:underline;">provide an abundant supply of housing for residents of rural areas;</span> and enhance the rural sense of community and quality of life.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.020'>36.70A.020</a> and 2023 c 228 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The following goals are adopted to guide the development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.040'>36.70A.040</a> and, where specified, also guide the development of regional policies, plans, and strategies adopted under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.210'>36.70A.210</a> and chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=47.80'>47.80</a> RCW. The following goals are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans, development regulations, and, where specified, regional plans, policies, and strategies:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Reduce sprawl.

Encourage economic development throughout the state that is consistent with adopted comprehensive plans, promote economic opportunity for all citizens of this state, especially for unemployed and for disadvantaged persons, promote the retention and expansion of existing businesses and recruitment of new businesses, recognize regional differences impacting economic development opportunities, and encourage growth in areas experiencing insufficient economic growth, all within the capacities of the state's natural resources, public services, and public facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. The property rights of landowners shall be protected from arbitrary and discriminatory actions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) Permits.

Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries, including productive timber, agricultural, and fisheries industries. Encourage the conservation of productive forestlands and productive agricultural lands, and discourage incompatible uses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) Open space and recreation. Retain open space and green space, enhance recreational opportunities, enhance fish and wildlife habitat, increase access to natural resource lands and water, and develop parks and recreation facilities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) Environment. Protect and enhance the environment and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality, and the availability of water.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens in the planning process, including the participation of vulnerable populations and overburdened communities, and ensure coordination between communities and jurisdictions to reconcile conflicts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate to serve the development at the time the development is available for occupancy and use without decreasing current service levels below locally established minimum standards.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(13) Historic preservation. Identify and encourage the preservation of lands, sites, and structures, that have historical or archaeological significance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(14) Climate change and resiliency.
