"Chronic illegal activity" means (a) a pervasive pattern of activity that threatens the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, town, or county including, but not limited to, open container violations, assaults, disturbances, disorderly conduct, or other criminal law violations, or as documented in crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, calls for service, field data, or similar records of a law enforcement agency for the city, town, county, or any other municipal corporation or any state agency; or (b) an unreasonably high number of citations for violations of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.502'>46.61.502</a> associated with the applicant's or licensee's operation of any licensed premises as indicated by the reported statements given to law enforcement upon arrest.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) The board may not issue a cannabis retail license for any premises not currently licensed if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The board receives a written objection from the legislative authority of an incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, relating to the physical location of the proposed premises;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The objection to the location from the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, is received by the board within 20 days of the board notifying the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, of the proposed cannabis retail location; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The objection to the issuance of a cannabis retail license at the specified location is based on a preexisting local ordinance limiting outlet density in a specific geographic area. For purposes of this subsection (11), a preexisting local ordinance is an ordinance enacted and in effect before the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed. No objection related to the physical location of a proposed premises may be made by a local government under this subsection (11) based on a local ordinance enacted after the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) After January 1, 2024, all cannabis licensees are encouraged but are not required to submit a social equity plan to the board. Upon confirmation by the board that a cannabis licensee who is not a social equity applicant, and who does not hold a social equity license issued under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.335'>69.50.335</a>, has submitted a social equity plan, the board must within 30 days reimburse such a licensee an amount equal to the cost of the licensee's annual cannabis license renewal fee.

This performance statement is only intended to be used for subsequent evaluation of the tax preference. It is not intended to create a private right of action by any party or be used to determine eligibility for preferential tax treatment.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The legislature categorizes this tax preference as one intended to provide tax relief for certain businesses or individuals, as indicated in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.32.808'>82.32.808</a>(2)(e).</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) It is the legislature's specific public policy objective to provide this tax preference to a designated class of taxpayers who are cannabis producers, processors, and retailers licensed under the cannabis social equity program in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.335'>69.50.335</a>. The legislature finds that this designated class of taxpayers faces unique barriers in their business relative to other producers, manufacturers, processors, and retailers in general, as well as relative to cannabis producers, cannabis processors, and cannabis retailers licensed outside of the cannabis social equity program, the majority of which have years of operating experience and growth after selecting prime locations within a market with a limited number of licenses and locations. The legislature further finds that eligibility for licensure through the cannabis social equity program is connected to documented evidence of disproportionate impacts of historical enforcement of criminal laws related to cannabis or other social disadvantages. The legislature finds that providing a time-limited business and occupations tax exemption for licensees in the cannabis social equity program will reduce the unique barriers and tax and financial burdens facing these businesses as they enter the established market and start to grow their businesses.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
