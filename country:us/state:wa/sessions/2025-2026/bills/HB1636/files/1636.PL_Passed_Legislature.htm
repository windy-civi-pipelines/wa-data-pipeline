Nothing in this title authorizes sales by on-sale licensees to other retail licensees. The board must establish by rule an obligation of on-sale spirits retailers to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Maintain a schedule by stock-keeping unit of all their purchases of spirits from spirits retail licensees, including combination spirits, beer, and wine licensees holding a license issued pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.24.035'>66.24.035</a>, indicating the identity of the seller and the quantities purchased; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Provide, not more frequently than quarterly, a report for each scheduled item containing the identity of the purchasing on-premises licensee and the quantities of that scheduled item purchased since any preceding report to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A distributor authorized by the distiller to distribute a scheduled item in the on-sale licensee's geographic area; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A distiller acting as distributor of the scheduled item in the area.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3)(a) Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this subsection, the board may issue spirits retail licenses only for premises comprising at least ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">ten thousand</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">10,000</span> square feet of fully enclosed retail space within a single structure, including storerooms and other interior auxiliary areas but excluding covered or fenced exterior areas, whether or not attached to the structure, and only to applicants that the board determines will maintain systems for inventory management, employee training, employee supervision, and physical security of the product substantially as effective as those of stores currently operated by the board with respect to preventing sales to or pilferage by underage or inebriated persons.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) License issuances and renewals are subject to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.24.010'>66.24.010</a> and the regulations adopted thereunder, including without limitation rights of cities, towns, county legislative authorities, the public, churches, schools, and public institutions to object to or prevent issuance of local liquor licenses. However, existing grocery premises licensed to sell beer and/or wine are deemed to be premises "now licensed" under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.24.010'>66.24.010</a>(9)(a) for the purpose of processing applications for spirits retail licenses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The board may not deny a spirits retail license to an otherwise qualified contract liquor store at its contract location or to the holder of former state liquor store operating rights sold at auction under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=66.24.620'>66.24.620</a> on the grounds of location, nature, or size of the premises to be licensed. The board may not deny a spirits retail license to applicants that are not contract liquor stores or operating rights holders on the grounds of the size of the premises to be licensed, if such applicant is otherwise qualified and the board determines that:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) There is no spirits retail license holder in the trade area that the applicant proposes to serve;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The applicant meets, or upon licensure will meet, the operational requirements established by the board by rule; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The licensee has not committed more than one public safety violation within the three years preceding application.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A retailer authorized to sell spirits for consumption on or off the licensed premises may accept delivery of spirits at its licensed premises, at another licensed premises as designated by the retailer, or at one or more warehouse facilities registered with the board, which facilities may also warehouse and distribute nonliquor items, and from which the retailer may deliver to its own licensed premises and, pursuant to sales permitted under subsection (1) of this section:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) To other retailer premises licensed to sell spirits for consumption on the licensed premises;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) To other registered facilities; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) To lawful purchasers outside the state.

The first payment is due October 1, 2012.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) This subsection (4) does not apply to craft distilleries for sales of spirits of the craft distillery's own production.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) In addition to the payment required under subsection (4) of this section, each licensee must pay an annual license renewal fee of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">one hundred sixty-six dollars</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">$166</span>. The board must periodically review and adjust the renewal fee as may be required to maintain it as comparable to annual license renewal fees for licenses to sell beer and wine not for consumption on the licensed premises. If required by law at the time, any increase of the annual renewal fee becomes effective only upon ratification by the legislature.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) As a condition to receiving and renewing a spirits retail license the licensee must provide training as prescribed by the board by rule for individuals who sell spirits or who manage others who sell spirits regarding compliance with laws and regulations regarding sale of spirits, including without limitation the prohibitions against sale of spirits to individuals who are underage or visibly intoxicated. The training must be provided before the individual first engages in the sale of spirits and must be renewed at least every five years. The licensee must maintain records documenting the nature and frequency of the training provided.
