Uninsured individuals are more likely to be in poor health and more likely to delay or forego needed health care services, which ultimately drives up the cost of care;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Federal law unjustly excludes certain categories of immigrants from receiving affordable health coverage. As a result, immigrants are disproportionately uninsured and at risk for poor health outcomes. In 2021, undocumented immigrants had an uninsured rate six times that of United States citizens;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Washington has a long history of working toward equity in immigrant health coverage. The state's basic health program covered low-income residents without regard to immigration status until it was dismantled in anticipation of affordable care act reforms which have proven to be insufficient in addressing the disparity in coverage. By contrast, the state's "cover all kids" law was retained and continues to be successful in reducing immigration-related inequity among Washington's children. In recent years, the Washington state legislature has worked to fill this gap by funding apple health expansion for fiscal year 2025 and by providing state subsidies that have been accessible to immigrant community members through the purchase of health insurance through Washington's Cascade care savings program; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) There are remaining opportunities for the state to seek federal flexibility to cover immigrants otherwise excluded from federal health programs, including funding apple health expansion to cover all income-eligible persons and subsidize qualified health and dental plans to bring their costs into parity with the affordable care act subsidized plans.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature intends to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Improve the health of all people in the state by extending health coverage options at parity to all Washington residents, regardless of immigration status, by:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Codifying a state medicaid equivalent program which is accessible at no cost to people who meet income eligibility standards for federal medicaid or federal insurance affordability programs, except for their immigration status; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Extending financial assistance for qualified health plans and qualified dental plans for enrollees who are ineligible for federal advance premium tax credits due to federal immigration status restrictions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Work towards equity in providing culturally diverse and linguistically appropriate care through these programs.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.09'>74.09</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The apple health expansion program is established.
