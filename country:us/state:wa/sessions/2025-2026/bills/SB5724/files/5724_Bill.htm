Dual credit programs are an important element of economic development for Washington because they equip students with the skills needed for high-skill, high-wage employment and continued education in high-demand sectors.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Strengthening dual credit programs and transitions from secondary to postsecondary education requires a coordinated statewide approach. This effort requires collaboration and leadership from the state board for community and technical colleges and the office of the superintendent of public instruction to ensure students can engage in all forms of dual credit opportunities that align with their career and academic interests.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Career and technical education dual credit is the most commonly accessed form of dual credit in Washington and has significant potential to improve equitable access to postsecondary pathways for students from all backgrounds. However, it lags behind other course-based dual credit programs in ensuring that students receive credit on their transcript while in high school, and that the credit they earn will transfer into the postsecondary institution of their choice.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, the legislature intends to streamline statewide and regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment by increasing the collaboration between state and local partners, studying the feasibility of improving the state's dual credit administrative data management system, creating and encouraging the use of statewide articulation agreements for career and technical education dual credit courses, and receiving recommendations on future amendments to state dual credit policies.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.600'>28A.600</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The state board for community and technical colleges and the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall collaborate with the following entities to streamline statewide and regional efforts that support students' dual credit access and attainment: Educational services districts, participating institutions of higher education, skill centers established under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.245'>28A.245</a> RCW, registered apprenticeship programs approved under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.04'>49.04</a> RCW, public high schools, and school districts operating within the educational service district.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the statewide and regional efforts required by subsection (1) of this section must include the following activities:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Developing, and updating annually, a comprehensive catalog of dual credit courses and programs offered to students enrolled in public high schools;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Aligning career and technical education dual credit programs with postsecondary credential pathways and apprenticeships leading to in-demand career fields;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Providing technical assistance to public high schools and institutions of higher education to improve the accuracy and speed of awarding dual credits and updating transcripts;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Providing professional development for staff of public high schools and institutions of higher education to develop, align, and articulate dual credit courses;
