As the state's population and legal needs evolve, it is imperative that the court reflects the geographic diversity of Washington to ensure a broad and representative judicial perspective.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature further finds that Article IV, section 3 of the Washington state Constitution provides that the supreme court justices shall be elected by voters statewide, ensuring that all Washingtonians have a voice in selecting the justices who serve them. However, this provision does not preclude the state from structuring judicial representation in a manner that promotes regional balance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature recognizes that, historically, the supreme court justices have disproportionately resided in certain urban areas, leaving eastern and central Washington underrepresented. To address this imbalance and enhance public trust in the judiciary, the legislature finds that a district-based residency system will provide fair regional representation while maintaining the integrity of the statewide election process.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Establish nine supreme court judicial districts, with one supreme court justice drawn from each, and each representing a distinct region of Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Require that each supreme court justice reside in the supreme court judicial district they represent at the time of their election and throughout their term; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Require that at least three of the nine supreme court judicial districts consist exclusively of the portions of the state located east of the Cascade mountains.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) By enacting these provisions, the legislature seeks to strengthen the connection between the judiciary and communities across Washington, enhance public confidence in the state's highest court, and ensure that all regions of the state have a voice in shaping the legal principles that govern Washington.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=2.04'>2.04</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) There shall be nine supreme court judicial districts in the state, with one supreme court justice drawn from each district:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) District 1 shall consist of King county;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) District 2 shall consist of Snohomish county;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) District 3 shall consist of Island, San Juan, Skagit, and Whatcom counties;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) District 4 shall consist of Pierce county;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) District 5 shall consist of Clallam, Grays Harbor, Jefferson, Kitsap, Mason, and Thurston counties;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) District 6 shall consist of Clark, Cowlitz, Lewis, Pacific, Skamania, and Wahkiakum counties;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) District 7 shall consist of Ferry, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, Spokane, and Stevens counties;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) District 8 shall consist of Adams, Asotin, Benton, Columbia, Franklin, Garfield, Grant, Walla Walla, and Whitman counties;
