While streamlined and eliminated offices, agencies, programs, and services may have provided some contribution to the public education system, the legislature finds that the cost and efficacy of these offices, agencies, programs, and services are at best ancillary to the provision of basic education. To the extent any offices, agencies, programs, or services streamlined or eliminated include functions that directly provide basic education to public school students, the legislature intends for those functions to be reconstituted and relocated within existing facilities where direct, daily interaction with students will occur.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.09'>43.09</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By November 1, 2025, the state auditor shall identify all offices, agencies, subsets of agencies, programs, and services that do not include direct, daily interaction with public school students during the school year.
