The legislature finds that decarbonization policies and artificial intelligence applications have accelerated demand on Washington's electricity grid. Nuclear energy: (1) Provides significant value to a decarbonized grid; (2) is a clean, firm complement to renewable resources; (3) has low land-use requirements while producing energy at scale; and (4) offers high-paying jobs and regional economic benefits.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Therefore, the legislature intends to study the benefits of expanded nuclear energy to Washington's clean energy economy.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The joint legislative audit and review committee shall enter into a contract with a third party to conduct a study on the benefits of nuclear energy and the deployment of small modular reactors.
