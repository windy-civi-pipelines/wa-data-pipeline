Upon granting such a stay, the court must award court costs and fees as allowed under this chapter;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(n)(i) The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' written notice to vacate prior to the end of the period or rental agreement and the tenant has committed four or more of the following violations, other than ones for monetary damages, within the preceding 12-month period, the tenant has remedied or cured the violation, and the landlord has provided the tenant a written warning notice at the time of each violation: A substantial breach of a material program requirement of subsidized housing, a substantial breach of a material term subscribed to by the tenant within the lease or rental agreement, or a substantial breach of a tenant obligation imposed by law;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Each written warning notice must:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) Specify the violation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) Provide the tenant an opportunity to cure the violation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(C) State that the landlord may choose to end the tenancy at the end of the rental term if there are four violations within a 12-month period preceding the end of the term; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(D) State that correcting the fourth or subsequent violation is not a defense to the ending of the lease under this subsection;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The 60-day notice to vacate must:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) State that the rental agreement will end upon the specified ending date for the rental term or upon a designated date not less than 60 days after the delivery of the notice, whichever is later;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) Specify the reason for ending the lease and supporting facts; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(C) Be served to the tenant concurrent with or after the fourth or subsequent written warning notice;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) The notice under this subsection must include all notices supporting the basis of ending the lease;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Any notices asserted under this subsection must pertain to four or more separate incidents or occurrences; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) This subsection (2)(n) does not absolve a landlord from demonstrating by admissible evidence that the four or more violations constituted breaches under (b) of this subsection at the time of the violation had the tenant not remedied or cured the violation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(o) The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 60 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant is required to register as a sex offender during the tenancy, or failed to disclose a requirement to register as a sex offender when required in the rental application or otherwise known to the property owner at the beginning of the tenancy;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(p) The tenant continues in possession after having received at least 20 days' advance written notice to vacate prior to the end of the rental period or rental agreement if the tenant has made unwanted sexual advances or other acts of sexual harassment directed at the property owner, property manager, property employee, or another tenant based on the person's race, gender, or other protected status in violation of any covenant or term in the lease.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) When a tenant has permanently vacated due to voluntary or involuntary events, other than by the ending of the tenancy by the landlord, a landlord must serve a notice to any remaining occupants who had coresided with the tenant at least six months prior to and up to the time the tenant permanently vacated, requiring the occupants to either apply to become a party to the rental agreement or vacate within 30 days of service of such notice. In processing any application from a remaining occupant under this subsection, the landlord may require the occupant to meet the same screening, background, and financial criteria as would any other prospective tenant to continue the tenancy. If the occupant fails to apply within 30 days of receipt of the notice in this subsection, or the application is denied for failure to meet the criteria, the landlord may commence an unlawful detainer action under this chapter.
