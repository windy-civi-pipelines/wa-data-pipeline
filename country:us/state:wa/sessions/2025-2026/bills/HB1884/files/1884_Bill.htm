In addition, the regulated businesses have demonstrated a commitment to the highest standards of safety and contribution to the state by submitting to high testing standards and regulatory oversight. Further, the regulated industry faces extreme challenges in competing with the unregulated illicit market because of the high taxes, inconsistent enforcement and complicated regulatory burdens placed on the regulated market. The legislature intends to partner with those who choose to be regulated and taxed to prevent illegal, unsafe activities that threaten the promise of a new approach to cannabis. Washington has established precedent in creating regulatory certainty, consistency in and prioritization of enforcement activities within the department of labor and industries. The legislature has also previously adopted legislation describing its direction to the agency regarding upholding compliance while prioritizing issues that concern youth access and public safety. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature that the liquor and cannabis board establish policies and procedures to create more regulatory certainty and set priorities for enforcement activities to focus such activities on the violations that most impact public health and safety and the sustainability of the regulated market. Further, it is the intent of the legislature that the two highest priorities for enforcement shall be youth prevention and prevention of inversion and diversion of cannabis. Finally, it is the intent of the legislature that the board place less priority and effort in pursuing enforcement actions on businesses that do not have a direct impact on these priorities.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.562'>69.50.562</a> and 2022 c 16 s 106 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The board must prescribe procedures for the following:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The establishment, within existing resources, and through a collaborative public process including outreach to the regulated cannabis industry, of a hierarchy of enforcement priorities to guide the board's enforcement of this chapter and the board's rules implementing this chapter.
