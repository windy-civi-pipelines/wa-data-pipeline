These companies frequently transfer earnings out-of-state, leaving limited opportunities for economic development within the regions where they operate.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that the lack of retained revenue from renewable energy projects exacerbates economic challenges in rural areas, including underfunded infrastructure, limited access to education and health care resources, and diminished prospects for local business growth. As a result, the economic benefits of hosting renewable energy facilities are not equitably shared with the communities that support their operations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to enact legislation that secures a new revenue option that would be supported by wind and solar production companies for rural communities to reinvest. By doing so, the legislature aims to create a more equitable distribution of benefits and foster long-term prosperity in these regions.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.46'>82.46</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The legislative authority of any county may impose an additional excise tax on the purchase and sale or transfer of a controlling interest of a renewable energy facility.
