The legislature acknowledges that traumatic brain injuries can lead to long-term cognitive, emotional, and physical challenges, often resulting in social isolation, difficulty in maintaining employment, and limited access to rehabilitation services. Additionally, family members and caregivers of individuals with a traumatic brain injury require ongoing support and guidance to navigate the complexities of available resources. Recent trends indicate that allocations have disproportionately favored virtual education and state-affiliated programs, leaving direct peer-to-peer groups and community-based support underfunded. The disappearance of many in-person support groups, due to financial constraints, has severely limited opportunities for individuals with a traumatic brain injury to connect, build essential life skills, and engage in meaningful recovery-focused activities.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature recognizes the urgent need to rebalance funding priorities to ensure that in-person support groups and community integration programs are adequately supported. To further facilitate community integration and education, the legislature finds that an annual conference should be sponsored by the traumatic brain injury council to bring together survivors, caregivers, professionals, and community members. This conference will serve as a platform for knowledge-sharing, networking, and collaboration on traumatic brain injury research, rehabilitation, and support services.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.63.110'>46.63.110</a> and 2024 c 308 s 3 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) A person found to have committed a traffic infraction shall be assessed a monetary penalty.
