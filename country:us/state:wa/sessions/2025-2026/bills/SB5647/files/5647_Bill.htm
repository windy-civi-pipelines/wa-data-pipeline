In adopting a rule for this purpose, the department must consider the following:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Persons must be treated as acting in concert when they have a relationship with each other such that one person influences or controls the actions of another through common ownership; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) When persons are not commonly owned or controlled, they must be treated as acting in concert only when the unity with which the purchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership interests supports a finding that they are acting as a single entity. If the acquisitions are completely independent, with each purchaser buying without regard to the identity of the other purchasers, then the acquisitions are considered separate acquisitions.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The term "sale" does not include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A transfer by gift, devise, or inheritance.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A transfer by transfer on death deed, to the extent that it is not in satisfaction of a contractual obligation of the decedent owed to the recipient of the property.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A transfer of any leasehold interest other than of the type mentioned above.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A cancellation or forfeiture of a vendee's interest in a contract for the sale of real property, whether or not such contract contains a forfeiture clause, or deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The partition of property by tenants in common by agreement or as the result of a court decree.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) The assignment of property or interest in property from one spouse or one domestic partner to the other spouse or other domestic partner in accordance with the terms of a decree of dissolution of marriage or state registered domestic partnership or in fulfillment of a property settlement agreement.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) The assignment or other transfer of a vendor's interest in a contract for the sale of real property, even though accompanied by a conveyance of the vendor's interest in the real property involved.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(h) Transfers by appropriation or decree in condemnation proceedings brought by the United States, the state or any political subdivision thereof, or a municipal corporation.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) A mortgage or other transfer of an interest in real property merely to secure a debt, or the assignment thereof.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(j) Any transfer or conveyance made pursuant to a deed of trust or an order of sale by the court in any mortgage, deed of trust, or lien foreclosure proceeding or upon execution of a judgment, or deed in lieu of foreclosure to satisfy a mortgage or deed of trust.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(k) A conveyance to the federal housing administration or veterans administration by an authorized mortgagee made pursuant to a contract of insurance or guaranty with the federal housing administration or veterans administration.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(l) A transfer in compliance with the terms of any lease or contract upon which the tax as imposed by this chapter has been paid or where the lease or contract was entered into prior to the date this tax was first imposed.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(m) The sale of any grave or lot in an established cemetery.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(n) A sale by the United States, this state or any political subdivision thereof, or a municipal corporation of this state.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(o) A sale to a regional transit authority or public corporation under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=81.112.320'>81.112.320</a> under a sale/leaseback agreement under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=81.112.300'>81.112.300</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(p) A transfer of real property, however effected, if it consists of a mere change in identity or form of ownership of an entity where there is no change in the beneficial ownership.

The property will not be considered in continued use if the department of social and health services finds that the property has failed, after a reasonable time to remedy, to meet any health and safety statutory or regulatory requirements. If the department of social and health services determines that the property fails to meet the requirements for continued use, the department of social and health services must notify the department and the real estate excise tax based on the value of the property at the time of the transfer into use as residential property for persons with developmental disabilities becomes immediately due and payable by the qualified entity.
