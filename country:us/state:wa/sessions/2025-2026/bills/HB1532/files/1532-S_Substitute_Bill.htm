Sales tax sourcing laws created a significant negative fiscal impact on this community thereby impacting the quality of life of residents in the valley. The valley is a vital job center to Washington state's economy and is one of the most diverse communities in the state. At the same time, with a concentration of warehousing, manufacturing, and shipping businesses, this community experiences negative impacts on resources that other communities do not experience. Furthermore, the legislature recognizes the dedicated funding in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.14.545'>82.14.545</a> for the manufacturing and warehousing job centers account, RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.14.550'>82.14.550</a>, is scheduled to expire on July 1, 2026.
