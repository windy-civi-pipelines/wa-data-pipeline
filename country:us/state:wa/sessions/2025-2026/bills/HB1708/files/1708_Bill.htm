Billions of dollars are spent annually by the state and local governments for programs to provide housing and services to people in need. This bill intends to help local jurisdictions provide information about their communities in a dashboard format. The legislature recognizes that the department of commerce already collects and posts some information about housing-related expenditures in a dashboard on its website, so this tool is to be created for use on the local government's websites.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.110'>43.110</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department of commerce shall contract for the provision of a computer application that every city and county can use to create a dashboard of information related to the jurisdiction's efforts to address homelessness that can be posted on a website.
