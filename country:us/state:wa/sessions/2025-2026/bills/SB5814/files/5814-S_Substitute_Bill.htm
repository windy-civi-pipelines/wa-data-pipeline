These revenues help the state meet its paramount duty to amply provide every child in the state with an education, including children who qualify for special education services, creating the opportunity for each child to succeed in school and achieve success in life. Revenues generated by this act will support health care and other programs that protect the safety and well-being of the public, including behavioral health services for those living with mental illness or substance use disorder, as well as supervision of individuals who have committed crimes. These revenues will also fund social services that provide critical, basic needs assistance for our state's most vulnerable residents, including support for those with developmental disabilities and long-term care for the elderly.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Furthermore, the legislature finds that the state's tax code must be periodically reviewed and updated to ensure that tax policy reflects our modern economy. The legislature recognizes that our state and nation have moved away from a predominantly goods-based economy towards a more service-based economy. As a result, Washington's tax code, which is heavily reliant on sales taxes, continues to reach a narrowing share of economic activity subject to the retail sales tax. Similar to the marketplace fairness act of 2017, which extended retail sales tax to remote retailers with no physical presence in the state to ensure the tax code reflected the growing shift of retail sales toward online sales and away from brick-and-mortar stores located in the state, so too must this legislature consider extending the retail sales tax to computer-related services, as well as remove exemptions to the retail sales tax for digital automated services which have not been updated since 2009, and other services to which it is more appropriate to apply retail sales tax in the state's current economy. The legislature further recognizes that taxes on tobacco products, which have largely gone unchanged over the last several decades, do not adequately capture new and emerging nicotine products. As certain new products come onto the market, they are exempt from excise tax, creating an unfair advantage in the market against their competitors.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Thus, to help meet the state's paramount duty of amply providing every child in the state with an education and to support the health and well-being of Washingtonians, the legislature intends to modernize the sales tax and taxes on nicotine products by extending retail sales tax to select services, repealing certain sales tax exemptions, applying taxes on tobacco to new nicotine products, and requiring certain large businesses to make a one-time prepayment of state sales tax collections.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">PART I</div><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">EXTENDING RETAIL SALES TAX TO SELECT SERVICES</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 101.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04.050'>82.04.050</a> and 2021 c 296 s 8 and 2021 c 143 s 2 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) "Sale at retail" or "retail sale" means every sale of tangible personal property (including articles produced, fabricated, or imprinted) to all persons irrespective of the nature of their business and including, among others, without limiting the scope hereof, persons who install, repair, clean, alter, improve, construct, or decorate real or personal property of or for consumers other than a sale to a person who:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Purchases for the purpose of resale as tangible personal property in the regular course of business without intervening use by such person, but a purchase for the purpose of resale by a regional transit authority under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=81.112.300'>81.112.300</a> is not a sale for resale;
