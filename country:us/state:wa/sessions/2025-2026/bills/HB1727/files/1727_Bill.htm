Unfortunately, not all students have access to these programs statewide, leading to disparate outcomes. According to recent data collected by the Washington library association, nearly 60 percent of school districts in Washington state have no certified teacher-librarian running their school library information and technology programs. Lack of access to these programs disproportionately impacts low-income families and families of color. Recent findings show that access to high-quality school libraries was one of the most significant factors in closing the literacy gap for students experiencing poverty.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Additionally, the legislature finds that the rise of misinformation and disinformation available through the internet necessitates comprehensive instruction by a qualified teacher-librarian in information literacy, digital citizenship, and media literacy for all K-12 students. The value of these programs was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. School districts with qualified teacher-librarians and strong school library information and technology programs were better able to support teachers, students, and families during remote learning.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature has shown support for school library information and technology programs through the passage of legislation clearly defining both programs and teacher-librarians. These programs have been acknowledged as critically important to supporting state-mandated learning goals, state learning standards, and high school graduation requirements through inclusion of both teacher-librarians and library materials as part of basic education in the prototypical school model. Teacher-librarians are seen as critical partners in the education of our students including in the equitable and successful use of educational technology. Despite this continued support from the legislature, data shows large areas of Washington where students do not have access to school library information and technology programs staffed by qualified teacher-librarians.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature intends to provide access to high-quality school library information and technology programs with qualified teacher-librarians for students and staff at all K-12 levels while also recognizing the value of allowing local school boards to decide how to most effectively implement these essential programs for their schools and students.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320'>28A.320</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->By September 1, 2026, each school district must adopt or amend:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) A policy that acknowledges the requirement for boards of directors to provide every student with access to school library information and technology programs as specified in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.240'>28A.320.240</a>; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Procedures that describe how students can access school library information and technology instruction, resources, and materials.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.320.240'>28A.320.240</a> and 2015 c 27 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The purpose of this section is to identify quality criteria for school library information and technology programs that support the student learning goals under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.150.210'>28A.150.210</a>, the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">essential academic learning requirements</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">state learning standards</span> under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.655.070'>28A.655.070</a>, and high school graduation requirements adopted under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.230.090'>28A.230.090</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Every board of directors shall provide resources and materials for the operation of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a</span> school library information and technology program((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">s as the board deems necessary for the proper education of the district's students or as otherwise required by law or rule of the superintendent of public instruction</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.
