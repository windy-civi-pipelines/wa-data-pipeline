The legislature further recognizes the positive benefit of religious practice in the form of positive behavior in institutions and in the community. The legislature intends to affirm and support religious practices for faith and cultural groups by providing opportunities to celebrate practices and events. The legislature therefore resolves to codify the opportunity for religious diets in state correctional facilities.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=72.09'>72.09</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The department shall make reasonable efforts to accommodate religious diets in state correctional facilities based on the request of the incarcerated individual.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) Reasonable efforts under this section include but are not limited to coordination and arrangements with a partnering nonprofit organization in the provision and delivery of a religious diet, including special menu items, meal enhancements, and donated foods.
