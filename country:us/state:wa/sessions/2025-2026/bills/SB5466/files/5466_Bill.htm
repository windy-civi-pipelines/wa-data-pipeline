ï»¿S-0756.1SENATE BILL 5466State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators Shewmake, Slatter, Conway, Nobles, and SaldaÃ±aRead first time 01/23/25.Referred to Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology.AN ACT Relating to improving reliability and capacity of the electric transmission system in Washington state; reenacting and amending RCW 43.84.092 and 43.84.092; adding new sections to chapter 43.21C RCW; adding new sections to chapter 80.28 RCW; adding a new chapter to Title 43 RCW; creating a new section; providing an effective date; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system is outdated and lacks the capacity to support the growing demand for clean electricity.(2) The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.(3) The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission office to improve transmission capacity, reliability, and efficiency by engaging in long-term planning; providing development services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the office to achieve the following goals:(a) Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;(b) Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;(c) Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;(d) Support economic growth; and(e) Maintain affordable energy rates.(5) The legislature intends to initially set up the Washington electric transmission office within the department of commerce in order to leverage existing energy policy expertise and administrative support. However, upon guidance from the office and the electric transmission advisory board, the legislature may decide to separate it from the department and establish it as an independent authority in the future.PART I - WASHINGTON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION OFFICENEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.

(1) The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system is outdated and lacks the capacity to support the growing demand for clean electricity.(2) The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.(3) The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission office to improve transmission capacity, reliability, and efficiency by engaging in long-term planning; providing development services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the office to achieve the following goals:(a) Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;(b) Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;(c) Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;(d) Support economic growth; and(e) Maintain affordable energy rates.(5) The legislature intends to initially set up the Washington electric transmission office within the department of commerce in order to leverage existing energy policy expertise and administrative support. However, upon guidance from the office and the electric transmission advisory board, the legislature may decide to separate it from the department and establish it as an independent authority in the future.PART I - WASHINGTON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION OFFICENEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2.
