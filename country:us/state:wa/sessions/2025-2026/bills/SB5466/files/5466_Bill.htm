Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system is outdated and lacks the capacity to support the growing demand for clean electricity.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission office to improve transmission capacity, reliability, and efficiency by engaging in long-term planning; providing development services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the office to achieve the following goals:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Support economic growth; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Maintain affordable energy rates.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature intends to initially set up the Washington electric transmission office within the department of commerce in order to leverage existing energy policy expertise and administrative support. However, upon guidance from the office and the electric transmission advisory board, the legislature may decide to separate it from the department and establish it as an independent authority in the future.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:1.5em;"><div style="font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">PART I - WASHINGTON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION OFFICE</div></div><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Advisory board" means the electric transmission advisory board.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Department" means the department of commerce.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Grid-enhancing technologies" means hardware and software that increases the capacity of electrical lines and improves the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the grid.
