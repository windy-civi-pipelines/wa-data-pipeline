ï»¿ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5466State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Environment, Energy & Technology (originally sponsored by Senators Shewmake, Slatter, Conway, Nobles, and SaldaÃ±a)READ FIRST TIME 02/19/25.AN ACT Relating to improving reliability and capacity of the electric transmission system in Washington state; reenacting and amending RCW 43.84.092 and 43.84.092; adding a new section to chapter 43.330 RCW; adding new sections to chapter 43.21C RCW; adding a new section to chapter 80.28 RCW; adding a new chapter to Title 43 RCW; creating a new section; providing an effective date; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system lacks the capacity to accommodate the growing demand for clean electricity.(2) The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.(3) The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission authority to improve transmission reliability, resilience, and affordability. The Washington electric transmission authority will serve as a centralized body to achieve these goals by engaging in long-term planning; providing development transmission services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the authority to achieve the following goals:(a) Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;(b) Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;(c) Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;(d) Support economic growth; and(e) Maintain affordable energy rates.PART I - WASHINGTON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AUTHORITYNEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Authority" means the Washington electric transmission authority.(2) "Board of directors" means the authority's board of directors.(3) "Department" means the department of commerce.(4) "Grid-enhancing technologies" means hardware and software that increases the capacity of electrical lines and improves the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the grid. Grid-enhancing technologies include, but are not limited to, dynamic line rating systems, advanced power flow control systems, and optimization software.(5) "Nonwires alternative" means any electrical grid investment that is intended to defer or remove the need to construct or upgrade components of a distribution and/or transmission system.(6) "Reconductoring with advanced conductors" means replacing the existing electric conductor with a conductor that increases the capacity of the electrical grid and/or improves efficiency, reliability, and safety. Advanced conductors may include, but are not limited to, conductors that have electrical resistance of at least 10 percent lower than existing conductors of a similar diameter, or high temperature low sag conductors.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3.

ï»¿ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5466State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Environment, Energy & Technology (originally sponsored by Senators Shewmake, Slatter, Conway, Nobles, and SaldaÃ±a)READ FIRST TIME 02/19/25.AN ACT Relating to improving reliability and capacity of the electric transmission system in Washington state; reenacting and amending RCW 43.84.092 and 43.84.092; adding a new section to chapter 43.330 RCW; adding new sections to chapter 43.21C RCW; adding a new section to chapter 80.28 RCW; adding a new chapter to Title 43 RCW; creating a new section; providing an effective date; and providing an expiration date.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. (1) The legislature finds that Washington has committed to decarbonizing its electricity system so that it is carbon neutral by 2030 and carbon free by 2045. Achieving those goals includes retiring coal and gas resources, adding new generation from renewable and nonemitting resources, and leveraging energy storage technologies. At the same time, demand for electricity is increasing significantly due to the electrification of vehicles, home heating and cooling, and manufacturing, and the expansion of the information services sector in Washington. There are significant federal, state, and private investments in clean energy development, including wind, solar, and battery storage, that support decarbonization goals and supply new electrical load. However, Washington's existing transmission system lacks the capacity to accommodate the growing demand for clean electricity.(2) The legislature also finds that extreme weather events and changes to seasonal highs and lows puts new strain on the existing transmission system and threatens reliability. Extreme weather events such as high-speed winds, floods, freezing, and heat domes can damage grid infrastructure and cause disruptions to the power supply. Warmer summers and colder winters increase the need for heating and cooling and thereby intensify and extend periods of peak demand.(3) The legislature further finds that to maintain reliability and build resilience, Washington's transmission system needs to be expanded and upgraded to access diverse portfolios of clean and reliable energy across the region, including solar resources in the southwest and wind resources across the mountain west. A more robust and updated transmission system will support affordability and reliability goals by enabling the efficient dispatch of least-cost resources across the region.(4) Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to create the Washington electric transmission authority to improve transmission reliability, resilience, and affordability. The Washington electric transmission authority will serve as a centralized body to achieve these goals by engaging in long-term planning; providing development transmission services; coordinating siting and permitting; leveraging research; and engaging with utilities, transmission developers, local jurisdictions, state agencies, regional entities, the federal government, and affected communities. The legislature intends for the authority to achieve the following goals:(a) Improve reliability and resilience, including during extreme weather events;(b) Increase access to low-cost renewable energy;(c) Achieve clean electricity requirements and greenhouse gas emissions limits;(d) Support economic growth; and(e) Maintain affordable energy rates.PART I - WASHINGTON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AUTHORITYNEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.(1) "Authority" means the Washington electric transmission authority.(2) "Board of directors" means the authority's board of directors.(3) "Department" means the department of commerce.(4) "Grid-enhancing technologies" means hardware and software that increases the capacity of electrical lines and improves the efficiency, reliability, and safety of the grid. Grid-enhancing technologies include, but are not limited to, dynamic line rating systems, advanced power flow control systems, and optimization software.(5) "Nonwires alternative" means any electrical grid investment that is intended to defer or remove the need to construct or upgrade components of a distribution and/or transmission system.(6) "Reconductoring with advanced conductors" means replacing the existing electric conductor with a conductor that increases the capacity of the electrical grid and/or improves efficiency, reliability, and safety. Advanced conductors may include, but are not limited to, conductors that have electrical resistance of at least 10 percent lower than existing conductors of a similar diameter, or high temperature low sag conductors.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3.
