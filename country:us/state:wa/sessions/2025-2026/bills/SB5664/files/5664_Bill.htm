Norway was the first country to establish a per se blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.05 in 1936. Since then, most countries have adopted blood alcohol concentration limits of 0.05 or lower. Eighty-four percent of the world's population lives in countries with a blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.05 or lower. Studies on the impacts of these laws around the world have found that reducing the limit from 0.08 to 0.05 results in an average reduction of fatalities involving alcohol-impaired driving by 11 percent annually. The national highway traffic safety administration found that a driver's risk of crash involvement at 0.05 is double the rate of a sober driver, which increases to three times the risk at 0.07.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds and declares that 2023 was the deadliest year on Washington roads since 1990. Washington state saw 734 fatal crashes resulting in the death of more than 810 people. Half of all fatal crashes involve a driver impaired by drugs or alcohol, and the state saw a 59 percent increase in crashes involving an impaired driver between 2019 and 2023. This alarming upward trend must be addressed if Washington state is going to meet its goal of target zero. </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The increase in Washingtonians choosing to drive while impaired points to a need to adjust Washington's impaired driving laws. Utah lowered the blood alcohol concentration limit for operating a motor vehicle from 0.08 to 0.05 in 2018 and found that 22 percent of people who drank alcohol said they changed their behavior as a result of the new law. Given the increase in traffic fatalities from impaired driving, the legislature declares that it is time to keep Washington's roads safer and lower the number of fatal crashes caused by impaired drivers by lowering the blood alcohol limit to 0.05.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.502'>46.61.502</a> and 2024 c 306 s 30 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A person is guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, cannabis, or any drug if the person drives a vehicle within this state:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) And the person has, within two hours after driving, an alcohol concentration of ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">0.08</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">0.05</span> or higher as shown by analysis of the person's breath or blood made under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.506'>46.61.506</a>; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The person has, within two hours after driving, a THC concentration of 5.00 or higher as shown by analysis of the person's blood made under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.506'>46.61.506</a>; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) While the person is under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor, cannabis, or any drug; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) While the person is under the combined influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor, cannabis, and any drug.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The fact that a person charged with a violation of this section is or has been entitled to use a drug under the laws of this state shall not constitute a defense against a charge of violating this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3)(a) It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (1)(a) of this section, which the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after the time of driving and before the administration of an analysis of the person's breath or blood to cause the defendant's alcohol concentration to be ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">0.08</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">0.05</span> or more within two hours after driving.

Notice of appeal must be filed within ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">thirty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">30</span> days after the date the final order is served or the right to appeal is waived.

The appellant must pay the costs associated with obtaining the record of the hearing before the hearing officer. The filing of the appeal does not stay the effective date of the suspension, revocation, or denial. A petition filed under this subsection must include the petitioner's grounds for requesting review. Upon granting petitioner's request for review, the court shall review the department's final order of suspension, revocation, or denial as expeditiously as possible. The review must be limited to a determination of whether the department has committed any errors of law. The superior court shall accept those factual determinations supported by substantial evidence in the record: (a) That were expressly made by the department; or (b) that may reasonably be inferred from the final order of the department. The superior court may reverse, affirm, or modify the decision of the department or remand the case back to the department for further proceedings. The decision of the superior court must be in writing and filed in the clerk's office with the other papers in the case. The court shall state the reasons for the decision. If judicial relief is sought for a stay or other temporary remedy from the department's action, the court shall not grant such relief unless the court finds that the appellant is likely to prevail in the appeal and that without a stay the appellant will suffer irreparable injury.

The stay shall not be longer than ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">one hundred fifty</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">150</span> days after the date charges are filed, or two years after the date of the arrest, whichever time period is shorter. If the court stays the suspension, revocation, or denial, it may impose conditions on such stay. If the person is otherwise eligible for licensing, the department shall issue a temporary license, or extend any valid temporary license under subsection (5) of this section, for the period of the stay.
