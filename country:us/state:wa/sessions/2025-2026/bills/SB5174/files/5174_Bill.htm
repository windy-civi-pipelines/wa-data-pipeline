RCW 70A.15.3550 and 2020 c 20 s 1117 are each amended to read as follows:((After July 1, 1988, any))Any person who sells, offers to sell, or knowingly advertises to sell a ((new woodstove))wood burning device in this state in violation of RCW 70A.15.3540 shall be subject to the penalties and enforcement actions under this chapter.Sec. 6. RCW 70A.15.3580 and 2020 c 20 s 1119 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Any person in a residence or commercial establishment which has an adequate source of heat without burning wood shall:(a) Not burn wood in any ((solid fuel))wood burning device whenever the department has determined under RCW 70A.15.6010 that any air pollution episode exists in that area;(b) Not burn wood in any ((solid fuel))wood burning device except those which are ((either Oregon department of environmental quality phase II or United States environmental protection agency certified or)) certified by the department under RCW 70A.15.3530(1) ((or a pellet stove either certified or issued an exemption by the United States environmental protection agency in accordance with Title 40, Part 60 of the Code of Federal Regulations)), in the geographical area and for the period of time that a first stage of impaired air quality has been determined, by the department or any authority, for that area.(i) A first stage of impaired air quality is reached when forecasted meteorological conditions are predicted to cause fine particulate levels to exceed ((thirty-five))35 micrograms per cubic meter, measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average, within ((forty-eight))48 hours, except for areas of fine particulate nonattainment or areas at risk for fine particulate nonattainment;(ii) A first stage burn ban for impaired air quality may be called for a county containing fine particulate nonattainment areas or areas at risk for fine particulate nonattainment, and when feasible only for the necessary portions of the county, when forecasted meteorological conditions are predicted to cause fine particulate levels to reach or exceed ((thirty))30 micrograms per cubic meter, measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average, within ((seventy-two))72 hours; and(c)(i) Not burn wood in any ((solid fuel))wood burning device in a geographical area and for the period of time that a second stage of impaired air quality has been determined by the department or any authority, for that area. A second stage of impaired air quality is reached when a first stage of impaired air quality has been in force and has not been sufficient to reduce the increasing fine particulate pollution trend, fine particulates are at an ambient level of ((twenty-five))25 micrograms per cubic meter measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average, and forecasted meteorological conditions are not expected to allow levels of fine particulates to decline below ((twenty-five))25 micrograms per cubic meter for a period of ((twenty-four))24 hours or more from the time that the fine particulates are measured at the trigger level.(ii) A second stage burn ban may be called without calling a first stage burn ban only when all of the following occur and shall require the department or the local air pollution control authority calling a second stage burn ban under this subsection to comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section:(A) Fine particulate levels have reached or exceeded ((twenty-five))25 micrograms per cubic meter, measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average;(B) Meteorological conditions have caused fine particulate levels to rise rapidly;(C) Meteorological conditions are predicted to cause fine particulate levels to exceed the ((thirty-five))35 micrograms per cubic meter, measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average, within ((twenty-four))24 hours; and(D) Meteorological conditions are highly likely to prevent sufficient dispersion of fine particulate.(iii) In fine particulate nonattainment areas or areas at risk for fine particulate nonattainment, a second stage burn ban may be called for the county containing the nonattainment area or areas at risk for nonattainment, and when feasible only for the necessary portions of the county, without calling a first stage burn ban only when (c)(ii)(A), (B), and (D) of this subsection have been met and meteorological conditions are predicted to cause fine particulate levels to reach or exceed ((thirty))30 micrograms per cubic meter, measured on a ((twenty-four))24-hour average, within ((twenty-four))24 hours.(2) Actions of the department and local air pollution control authorities under this section shall preempt actions of other state agencies and local governments for the purposes of controlling air pollution from ((solid fuel))wood burning devices, except where authorized by chapter 199, Laws of 1991.(3)(a) The department or any local air pollution control authority that has called a second stage burn ban under the authority of subsection (1)(c)(ii) of this section shall, within ((ninety))90 days, prepare a written report describing:(i) The meteorological conditions that resulted in their calling the second stage burn ban;(ii) Whether the agency could have taken actions to avoid calling a second stage burn ban without calling a first stage burn ban; and(iii) Any changes the department or authority is making to its procedures of calling first stage and second stage burn bans to avoid calling a second stage burn ban without first calling a first stage burn ban.(b) After consulting with affected parties, the department shall prescribe the format of such a report and may also require additional information be included in the report. All reports shall be sent to the department and the department shall keep the reports on file for not less than five years and available for public inspection and copying in accordance with RCW 42.56.090.(4) For the purposes of chapter 219, Laws of 2012, an area at risk for nonattainment means an area where the three-year average of the annual ((ninety-eighth))98th percentile of ((twenty-four))24 hour fine particulate values is greater than ((twenty-nine))29 micrograms per cubic meter, based on the years 2008 through 2010 monitoring data.(5)(a) Nothing in this section restricts a person from installing or repairing a certified ((solid fuel))wood burning device ((approved by the department under the program established))that meets the applicable emission standard and certification requirements adopted by the department under RCW 70A.15.3530 in a residence or commercial establishment or from replacing a ((solid fuel))wood burning device with a certified ((solid fuel))wood burning device that meets the applicable emission standard and certification requirements adopted by the department under RCW 70A.15.3530. Nothing in this section restricts a person from burning wood in a ((solid fuel))wood burning device, regardless of whether a burn ban has been called, if there is an emergency power outage. In addition, for the duration of an emergency power outage, nothing restricts the use of a ((solid fuel))wood burning device or the temporary installation, repair, or replacement of a ((solid fuel))wood burning device to prevent the loss of life, health, or business.(b) For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency power outage includes:(i) Any natural or human-caused event beyond the control of a person that leaves the person's residence or commercial establishment temporarily without an adequate source of heat other than the ((solid fuel))wood burning device; or(ii) A natural or human-caused event for which the governor declares an emergency in an area under chapter 43.06 RCW, including a public disorder, disaster, or energy emergency under RCW 43.06.010(12).Sec. 7. RCW 70A.15.3600 and 2020 c 20 s 1121 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Unless allowed by rule under chapter 34.05 RCW, a person shall not cause or allow any of the following materials to be burned in any residential ((solid fuel))wood burning device:(a) Garbage;(b) Treated wood;(c) Plastics;(d) Rubber products;(e) Animals;(f) Asphaltic products;(g) Waste petroleum products;(h) Paints; ((or))(i) Coal; or(j) Any substance, other than properly seasoned fuel wood, which normally emits dense smoke or obnoxious odors.(2) To achieve and maintain attainment in areas of nonattainment for fine particulates in accordance with section 172 of the federal clean air act, a local air pollution control authority or the department may, after meeting requirements in subsection (3) of this section, prohibit the use of ((solid fuel))wood burning devices, except:(a) Fireplaces as defined in RCW 70A.15.3510(3), except if needed to meet federal requirements as a contingency measure in a state implementation plan for a fine particulate nonattainment area; or(b) Woodstoves meeting the standards set forth in RCW 70A.15.3580(1)(b)((; or(c) Pellet stoves)).(3) Prior to prohibiting the use of ((solid fuel))wood burning devices under subsection (2) of this section, the department or the local air pollution control authority must:(a) Seek input from any city, county, or jurisdictional health department affected by the proposal to prohibit the use of ((solid fuel))wood burning devices; and(b) Make written findings that:(i) The area is designated as an area of nonattainment for fine particulate matter by the United States environmental protection agency, or is in maintenance status under that designation;(ii) Emissions from ((solid fuel))wood burning devices in the area are a major contributing factor for violating the national ambient air quality standard for fine particulates; and(iii) The area has an adequately funded program to assist low-income households to secure an adequate source of heat, which may include woodstoves meeting the requirements of RCW 70A.15.3510(((7)))(9).(4) If and only if the nonattainment area is within the jurisdiction of the department and the legislative authority of a city or county within the area of nonattainment formally expresses concerns with the department's written findings, then the department must publish on the department's website the reasons for prohibiting the use of ((solid fuel))wood burning devices under subsection (2) of this section that includes a response to the concerns expressed by the city or county legislative authority.(5) When a local air pollution control authority or the department prohibits the use of ((solid fuel))wood burning devices as authorized by this section, the cities, counties, and jurisdictional health departments serving the area shall cooperate with the department or local air pollution control authority as the department or the local air pollution control authority implements the prohibition. The responsibility for actual enforcement of the prohibition shall reside solely with the department or the local air pollution control authority. A city, county, or jurisdictional health department serving a fine particulate nonattainment area may agree to assist with enforcement activities.(6) A prohibition issued by a local air pollution control authority or the department under this section shall not apply to:(a) A person in a residence or commercial establishment that does not have an adequate source of heat without burning wood; or(b) A person with a shop or garage that is detached from the main residence or commercial establishment that does not have an adequate source of heat in the detached shop or garage without burning wood.(7) On June 7, 2012, and prior to January 1, 2015, the local air pollution control authority or the department shall, within available resources, provide assistance to households using ((solid fuel))wood burning devices to reduce the emissions from those devices or change out to a lower emission device. Prior to the effective date of a prohibition, as defined in this section, on the use of uncertified stoves, the department or local air pollution control authority shall provide public education in the nonattainment area regarding how households can reduce their emissions through cleaner burning practices, the importance of respecting burn bans, and the opportunities for assistance in obtaining a cleaner device. If the area is designated as a nonattainment area as of January 1, 2015, or if required by the United States environmental protection agency, the local air pollution control authority or the department may prohibit the use of uncertified devices.(8) As used in this section:(a) "Jurisdictional health department" means a city, county, city-county, or district public health department.(b) "Prohibit the use" or "prohibition" may include requiring disclosure of an uncertified device, removal, or rendering inoperable, as may be ((approved))adopted by rule by a local air pollution control authority or the department. The effective date of such a rule may not be prior to January 1, 2015. However, except as provided in RCW 64.06.020 relating to the seller disclosure of wood burning appliances, any such prohibition may not include imposing separate time of sale obligations on the seller or buyer of real estate as part of a real estate transaction.--- END ---
