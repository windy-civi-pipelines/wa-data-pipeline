In 2015, the United States environmental protection agency established new air quality standards for certain wood burning devices, setting a compliance date for step two of the standards of May 15, 2020.

Similarly, a 2024 report by the United States office of the inspector general found that the environmental protection agency failed to properly oversee and administer the wood heater program and as a result, wood burning devices that do not meet clean air act standards may be offered for sale unbeknownst to consumers.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature intends to:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Protect public health and the environment by aligning state standards for emissions with existing federal standards, where federal standards are more stringent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Protect consumers from woodstoves improperly certified by the environmental protection agency by creating a voluntary state wood burning device verification program; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Support voluntary verification by allowing the department of ecology to add voluntary verification as a criterion in determining which stoves qualify for regional wood stove change-out programs and the wood smoke reduction grant program.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.3510'>70A.15.3510</a> and 2020 c 20 s 1115 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.3510'>70A.15.3510</a> through  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.3620'>70A.15.3620</a>:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Authority" means any air pollution control agency whose jurisdictional boundaries are coextensive with the boundaries of one or more counties.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Department" means the department of ecology.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Fireplace" means: (a) Any permanently installed masonry fireplace; or (b) any factory-built metal ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">solid fuel</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">wood</span> burning device designed to be used with an open combustion chamber and without features to control the air to fuel ratio.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "New woodstove" means: (a) A woodstove that is sold at retail, bargained, exchanged, or given away for the first time by the manufacturer, the manufacturer's dealer or agency, or a retailer; and (b) has not been so used to have become what is commonly known as "secondhand" within the ordinary meaning of that term.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Opacity" means the degree to which an object seen through a plume is obscured, stated as a percentage.
