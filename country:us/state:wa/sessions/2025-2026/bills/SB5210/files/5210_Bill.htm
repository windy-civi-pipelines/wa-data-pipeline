Research indicates that students are more likely to fail a class in the ninth grade than in any other grade, but also shows that students who pass all their ninth grade classes are up to four times more likely to graduate.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that targeted approaches have been shown to increase ninth grade on-track scores in schools. These approaches include establishing success teams that regularly review data regarding student attendance, behavior, and grades to identify when a student may be falling behind and intervene with strategic supports. Through coaching and collaboration these success teams also share best practices, evaluate outcome data, and progress towards creating a sustainable framework that can be implemented in subsequent school years.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature acknowledges the impact of the ninth grade success team pilot program established in 2019, which resulted in four out of five school districts reporting immediate and sustained increases in their ninth grade on-track rates. The program has expanded to 68 participating schools in the 2024-25 school year, and a recent evaluation has shown that participating schools through the 2023-24 school year have on-track rates that are 6.69 percentage points higher than comparison schools. The legislature now intends to create a permanent ninth grade success grant program to expand access across Washington state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.175'>28A.175</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall establish and administer the ninth grade success grant program.
