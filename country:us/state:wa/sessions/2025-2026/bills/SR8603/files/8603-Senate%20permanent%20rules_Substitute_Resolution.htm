A member of the senate voting remotely is considered in attendance within the bar of the senate if the member is participating in the session through a remote access program established by the secretary of the senate as provided in Senate Rule 70.

With respect to any senators participating remotely under the authority of Senate Rule 8, each caucus shall designate a single member who is charged with seeking recognition on behalf of a senator from that caucus who is participating remotely and wishes to speak. Any senator participating remotely who wishes to speak in debate or submit any matter permitted by Senate Rule 8 to the senate, shall notify the designated member of the senator's desire to speak. The designated member shall seek recognition under the provisions of this section on behalf of the senator participating remotely and, upon recognition, the designated member shall defer to the senator participating remotely. No senator shall impeach the motives of any other member or speak more than twice (except for explanation) during the consideration of any one question, on the same day or a second time without leave, when others who have not spoken desire the floor, but incidental and subsidiary questions arising during the debate shall not be considered the same question. A majority of the members present may further limit the number of times a member may speak on any question and may limit the length of time a member may speak but, unless a demand for the previous question has been sustained, a member shall not be denied the right to speak at least once on each question, nor shall a member be limited to less than two minutes on each question.

A motion to reconsider shall have precedence over every other motion, except a motion to adjourn; and when the senate adjourns while a motion to reconsider is pending or before passing the order of motions, the right to move a reconsideration shall continue to the next day of sitting. On and after the tenth day prior to adjournment sine die of any session, as determined pursuant to Article 2, Section 12, or concurrent resolution, or in the event that the measure is subject to a senate rule or resolution or a joint rule or concurrent resolution, which would preclude consideration on the next day of sitting a motion to reconsider shall only be in order on the same day upon which notice of reconsideration is given and may be made at any time that day.

This rule does not apply during the five days prior to any cutoff established by concurrent resolution nor does it apply to any measure exempted from the resolution.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">3. During its consideration of or vote on any bill, resolution or memorial, the deliberations of any committee or subcommittee of the senate shall be open to the public. In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct at any such deliberations, the chair shall order the sergeant at arms to suppress the same and may order the meeting closed to any person or persons creating such disturbance.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">4. No committee shall amend a measure, adopt a substitute bill, or vote upon any measure or appointment absent a quorum. A committee may conduct a hearing absent a quorum. A majority of any committee shall constitute a quorum and committees shall be considered to have a quorum present unless the question is raised. Any question as to quorum not raised at the time of the committee action is deemed waived.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">5. Bills reported to the senate from a standing committee must have a majority report, which shall be prepared upon a printed standing committee report form; shall be adopted at a regularly or specially called meeting during a legislative session and shall be signed by a majority of the committee; and shall carry only one of the following recommendations:</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">a. Do pass;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">b. Do pass as amended;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">c. That a substitute bill be substituted therefor, and the substitute bill do pass; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">d. Without recommendation.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">In addition to one of the above-listed recommendations, a report may also recommend that a bill be referred to another committee.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">6. A majority report of a committee must carry the signatures of a majority of the members of the committee. In the event a committee has a quorum pursuant to subsection 4 of this rule, a majority of the members present may act on a measure, subject to obtaining the signatures of a majority of the members of the committee on the majority report. If, after executive action on a measure, the signatures of all members are not included on either a majority or minority report, the committee shall hold the signature sheets for the measure for 24 hours, not counting Saturdays or Sundays, from adjournment of the committee hearing at which executive action was taken on the measure. This 24-hour hold period applies even if a majority of the members of the committee has signed the majority report. After the 24-hour hold period, the signature sheets must be submitted to the workroom if there is a majority of signatures on the majority report. Once signature sheets have been submitted to the senate workroom by committee staff, a member may not sign or remove his or her signature from a majority or minority signature sheet. If a majority of members of the committee have not signed the majority report, the measure or appointment remains in the possession of the committee. The 24-hour hold period does not apply within the five days preceding any cutoff date and does not apply to a biennial or supplemental omnibus operating budget, omnibus capital budget, or omnibus transportation budget.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">7. Any measure, appointment, substitute bill, or amendment still within a committee's possession before it has been reported out to the full senate may be reconsidered to correct an error, change language, or otherwise accurately reflect the will of the committee in its majority and minority reports to the full senate. Any such reconsideration may be made at any time, by any member of the committee, provided that the committee has not yet reported the measure, appointment, substitute bill, or amendment out to the full senate. Any such reconsideration made after a vote has been taken or signatures obtained will require a new vote and signature sheet. Any measure which does not receive a majority vote of the members present may be reconsidered at that meeting and may again be considered upon motion of any committee member if one day's notice of said motion is provided to all committee members.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">8. Any member of the committee not concurring in the majority report may sign a minority report containing a recommendation of "do not pass" or "without recommendation," which shall be signed by those members of the committee subscribing thereto, and submitted with the majority report. Unless the signatory of a minority report expressly indicates a "do not pass" recommendation, the member's vote shall be deemed to be "without recommendation." In every case where a majority report form is circulated for signature, a minority report form shall also be circulated.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">9. When a committee reports a substitute for an original bill with the recommendation that the substitute bill do pass, it shall be in order to read the substitute bill the first time and have the same ordered printed.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">A motion for the substitution of the substitute bill for the original bill shall not be in order until the committee on rules places the original bill on the second reading calendar.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">10. No vote in any committee shall be taken by secret ballot nor shall any committee have a policy of secrecy as to any vote on action taken in such committee.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">11. All reports of standing committees must be on the secretary's desk one hour prior to convening of the session in order to be read at said session. During any special session of the legislature or within the three days preceding any cut-off date or sine die, this rule may be suspended by a majority vote of those present. This rule does not apply to reports of biennial or supplemental omnibus operating budget, omnibus capital budget, or omnibus transportation budget bill.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">12. For purposes of this rule, a committee is deemed to have reported a measure, appointment, substitute bill, or amendment out when it has delivered its majority and minority reports to the senate workroom. After such delivery, the committee no longer has possession of the measure, appointment, substitute bill, or amendment and no further committee action, including reconsideration or a member adding or removing his or her signature to a majority or minority report, may be taken.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">13. All committees will rely upon and use the Electronic Bill Book. Committee staff should add all materials relating to hearings, work sessions, or executive sessions to the Electronic Bill Book as early as possible or when the material has been made public. Paper copies will not be provided to members. All materials submitted by the public shall be submitted electronically.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">14. All committees will use the online Committee Sign-In system. All committee members will be able to view the list of individuals who have signed in to testify on each measure or appointment. Members of the public wishing to testify in-person or remotely may sign up remotely no later than one hour before the committee is scheduled to meet.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">15. With the exception of the ways and means and transportation committees, the chairs of standing committees must publish the list of measures and appointments that may be considered for executive session by 4:00 p.m. two days preceding executive session. The chairs of the ways and means committee and the transportation committee must publish the list of measures and appointments that may be considered for executive session by 7:00 p.m. two days preceding executive session. A chair, with the consent of the ranking member, has discretion to waive this deadline in extraordinary circumstances. A published measure or appointment may be rescheduled for executive action at the committee's next meeting without additional notice, provided no additional amendments are considered.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">16. Members must have amendment requests to nonpartisan committee staff by 12:00 p.m. the day before scheduled executive action. A chair, with the consent of the ranking member, has discretion to waive this deadline in extraordinary circumstances or to accept technical revisions to perfect an amendment. Members should be considerate of staff and turn in amendment requests earlier if they are long or complex, keeping in mind the final deadline for consideration of amendments.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">17. All amendments, including substitutes, must be sponsored by a committee member. All amendments and effect statements must be either drafted or reviewed, or both, by nonpartisan committee staff. To be eligible for consideration at an executive session in a committee meeting scheduled to begin prior to 12:00 p.m., amendments must be released from confidentiality and posted to the Electronic Bill Book for committee members and the public by 4:00 p.m. the day before the executive session or the amendments will be considered out of order. To be eligible for consideration at an executive session in a committee meeting scheduled to begin on or after 12:00 p.m., amendments must be released from confidentiality and posted to the Electronic Bill Book for committee members and the public by 7:00 p.m. the day before the executive session or the amendments will be considered out of order. A chair with the consent of the ranking member has discretion to waive this deadline in extraordinary circumstances or to accept technical revisions to perfect an amendment.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">18. A committee chair may choose to allow committee members to participate remotely in committee meetings. The committee chair shall notify the secretary of the senate prior to the first day of the legislative session if the chair will allow committee members to participate remotely. A chair that initially chooses to allow only in-person participation may later choose to allow remote participation but must provide the secretary of the senate with notice of the change at least 24 hours prior to the committee hearing in which the change will become effective. Once a chair has chosen to allow members to participate remotely, this choice cannot be changed during the remainder of the session. If a chair allows committee members to participate remotely, those members will be considered "present" for the purposes of this rule and Senate Rule 49. All committee meetings shall be chaired in person. A chair may participate remotely in a committee meeting when another member of the committee is acting as chair. Members participating remotely shall be allowed to participate in committee activities to the same extent as those attending in person.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Committee Meetings During Sessions</span></div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rule 46.</span> No committee shall sit during the daily session of the senate unless by special leave.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">No committee shall sit during any scheduled caucus.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Reading of Reports</span></div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rule 47.</span> The majority report, and minority report, if there be one, together with the names of the signers thereof, shall be read by the secretary, unless the reading be dispensed with by the senate, and all committee reports shall be spread upon the journal.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Recalling Bills from Committees</span></div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rule 48.</span> Any standing committee of the senate may be relieved of further consideration of any bill, regardless of prior action of the committee, by a majority vote of the senators elected or appointed.

(See also Senate Rules 63 and 64.) A bill may not be referred to the committee on rules for second reading unless a standing committee has held a public hearing on the bill. This rule does not apply when the committee is considering a bill whose official companion has already been heard. By a majority vote of the committee members present at any executive session, the public hearing requirement may be dispensed with when the committee is considering a biennial or supplemental omnibus operating budget, omnibus capital budget, or omnibus transportation budget bill and the committee has already had a hearing on a substantially similar omnibus budget bill.</div><div style="text-indent:0pt;text-align:center;margin-top:4.5pt;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rules Committee</span></div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rule 50.</span> The lieutenant governor shall be a voting member and the chair of the committee on rules.

Any member desiring to introduce a bill, joint resolution, or joint memorial shall file the same with the secretary of the senate by noon of the day before the convening of the session at which said bill, joint resolution, or joint memorial is to be introduced. Sponsor sheets shall be available in both physical and electronic formats. A member may introduce a bill electronically by emailing the bill to the office of the code reviser.
