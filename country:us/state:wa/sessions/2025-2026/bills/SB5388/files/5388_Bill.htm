As part of that legislation, revisions were made to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.662'>9.94A.662</a> to state that treatment services provided in prisons be licensed by the department of health.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that prior to this time, the department of social and health services conducted oversight of the department of corrections behavioral health certification services, and that the department of health has interpreted Second Substitute Senate Bill No. 6211 to require licensure to standards above and beyond those previously required. The legislature finds that accomplishing this would require significant new resources.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that national standards could be implemented in lieu of the department of health licensing for significant fiscal savings without compromising the quality of services provided.
