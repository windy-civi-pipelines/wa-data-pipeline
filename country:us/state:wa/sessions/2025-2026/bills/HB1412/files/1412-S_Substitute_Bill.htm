Among these are the Middle Eastern and North African populations who have, over generations, made profound contributions to the state's economic growth, cultural vibrancy, and civic life. The legislature recognizes that Middle Eastern and North African Americans share ancestral, cultural, and historical ties to the regions commonly referred to as the Middle East and North Africa. While these communities are richly diverse in languages, religions, and traditions, they also share common experiences shaped by how others have perceived and categorized them over time. These perceptions have influenced how Middle Eastern and North African Americans are treated and represented in public, social, and institutional settings in the state.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds that, despite their contributions, Middle Eastern and North African Americans navigate systems that neither fully serve nor see them; a reality further compounded by their historic erasure in public data and decision-making processes across the state. As highlighted in a recent study from the University of Washington Tacoma, Middle Eastern and North African communities continue to face persistent barriers to equity and opportunity, including limited access to culturally and linguistically appropriate health care, economic inequities driving housing instability, underemployment due to unrecognized credentials, and educational systems that fail to reflect their lived experiences or meet their needs. These challenges reflect a need for intentional representation and solutions that are led by the voices and lived experiences of Middle Eastern and North African communities. By addressing these disparities, the state can honor the vital cultural, economic, and civic contributions of Middle Eastern and North African Americans and build a future where all Washingtonians can thrive.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature acknowledges that the cultural richness of Middle Eastern and North African Americans is rooted in histories that span centuries, shaped by interactions that have included both cooperation and conflict over time. The legislature further acknowledges that two significant influences on Middle Eastern and North African communities have been the role of religion and the influence of international policies. While these factors are important, they represent only a part of the depth and diversity of Middle Eastern and North African lived experiences. As such, the commission may discuss these influences but shall not focus solely on them.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Therefore, the legislature intends to establish the commission to amplify the voices of Middle Eastern and North African communities, advocate for equitable opportunities, and cultivate stronger connections between Middle Eastern and North African Americans in Washington and decision-making bodies. A key focus of the commission will be to improve the collection of qualitative and quantitative data on Middle Eastern and North African Americans to better inform state policy and programs to meet their needs. Through this work, the commission will contribute to a Washington that uplifts and values its diversity while working toward shared prosperity for all its communities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definition in this section applies throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->"Commission" means the Washington state commission on Middle Eastern and North African Americans.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The Washington state commission on Middle Eastern and North African Americans is established in the office of the governor.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) The commission shall consist of 12 members appointed by the governor.
