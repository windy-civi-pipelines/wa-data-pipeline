The state of Washington is in the middle of a workforce and affordability crisis. Flexible, online, affordable options are an essential part of the solution. Allowing colleges to reach students regarding entirely online course offerings outside their district is a first step in creating a virtual campus. A virtual campus, like what California community colleges have created, would provide students affordable options without having to move or find transportation. Students in Washington state should have a single place where they can register for online classes and cross enroll. A virtual campus would help students upskill or reskill and allow for students to have access to online classes needed for their degree when they live out-of-district.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that Washington state cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. Washington state needs skilled workers, and it should not matter where a student lives to receive the right education. Therefore, the legislature intends that, by allowing respective community and technical colleges to reach students out-of-district, a conversation can begin around establishing a virtual campus for all Washingtonians.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50'>28B.50</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Community and technical colleges may distribute information on their respective colleges outside of their district when it pertains to entirely online course offerings.
