ï»¿ENGROSSED SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 5663State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenate Higher Education & Workforce Development (originally sponsored by Senators Slatter, Nobles, Frame, Lovick, and Valdez)READ FIRST TIME 02/18/25.AN ACT Relating to entirely online course offerings at community and technical colleges; adding a new section to chapter 28B.50 RCW; and creating a new section.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that the community and technical college system is an important conduit to our communities and is a key for the state to meet the 70 percent credential goal and to fill workforce gaps. The state of Washington is in the middle of a workforce and affordability crisis. Flexible, online, affordable options are an essential part of the solution. Allowing colleges to reach students regarding entirely online course offerings outside their district is a first step in creating a virtual campus. A virtual campus, like what California community colleges have created, would provide students affordable options without having to move or find transportation. Students in Washington state should have a single place where they can register for online classes and cross enroll. A virtual campus would help students upskill or reskill and allow for students to have access to online classes needed for their degree when they live out-of-district.The legislature further finds that Washington state cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines. Washington state needs skilled workers, and it should not matter where a student lives to receive the right education. Therefore, the legislature intends that, by allowing respective community and technical colleges to reach students out-of-district, a conversation can begin around establishing a virtual campus for all Washingtonians.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 28B.50 RCW to read as follows:(1) Community and technical colleges may distribute information on their respective colleges outside of their district when it pertains to entirely online course offerings.
