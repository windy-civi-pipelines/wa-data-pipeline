ï»¿H-0363.1HOUSE BILL 1169State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Leavitt, Ryu, Berry, Bronoske, Pollet, Ormsby, and HillPrefiled 01/06/25.Read first time 01/13/25.Referred to Committee on Community Safety.AN ACT Relating to offenses involving fabricated depictions of minors; amending RCW 9.68A.050, 9.68A.053, 9.68A.060, 9.68A.070, 9.68A.075, and 9.68A.110; reenacting and amending RCW 9.68A.011; and creating a new section.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.Sec. 2.
