Recently, controversial speech has been met, not with competing ideas, but with attempts to silence the speakers. The legislature agrees with Justice Brandeis that "the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence," and with Justice Kennedy that "the remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true." The legislature further finds that the greatest breeding ground for the principles of freedom of expression are our institutions of higher education. Therefore, in order to promote and protect principles of freedom of expression, the legislature intends to require its institutions of higher education to adopt the Chicago principles as presented by the University of Chicago's committee on freedom of expression.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10'>28B.10</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The boards of regents of the state universities, the boards of trustees of the regional universities, The Evergreen State College, and the boards of trustees of each community and technical college district, in collaboration with faculty and students, shall each adopt a free speech policy statement.
