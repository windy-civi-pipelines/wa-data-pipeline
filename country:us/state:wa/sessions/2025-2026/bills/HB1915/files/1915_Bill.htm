At such time as the compensation is paid, the tenant shall be given written notice of at least 12 months in which to vacate that includes department of commerce contact information, as provided by the department of commerce, identifying financial and technical assistance programs available to support eligible tenant relocation activities, and the tenant shall continue to pay rent for as much time as he or she remains in the mobile home park or manufactured housing community.

"Criminal activity" means a criminal act defined by statute or ordinance that threatens the health, safety, or welfare of the tenants. A park owner seeking to evict a tenant or occupant under this subsection need not produce evidence of a criminal conviction, even if the alleged misconduct constitutes a criminal offense. Notice from a law enforcement agency of criminal activity constitutes sufficient grounds, but not the only grounds, for an eviction under this subsection. Notification of the seizure of illegal drugs under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.20.155'>59.20.155</a> is evidence of criminal activity and is grounds for an eviction under this subsection. The requirement that any tenant or occupant register as a sex offender under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.44.130'>9A.44.130</a> is grounds for eviction of the sex offender under this subsection.

The parties may agree in writing to mediation by an independent third party or through industry mediation procedures. If the parties cannot agree, then mediation shall be through industry mediation procedures. A duty is imposed upon both parties to participate in the mediation process in good faith for a period of 10 days for an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section. It is a defense to an eviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section that a landlord did not participate in the mediation process in good faith.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Except for a tenant evicted under subsection (1)(c) or (f) of this section, a tenant evicted from a mobile home park under this section shall be allowed 120 days within which to sell the tenant's mobile home, manufactured home, or park model in place within the mobile home park: PROVIDED, That the tenant remains current in the payment of rent incurred after eviction, and pays any past due rent, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs at the time the rental agreement is assigned.

The jury, or the court, if the proceedings are tried without a jury, shall also assess the damages arising out of the tenancy occasioned to the landlord by any forcible entry, or by any forcible or unlawful detainer, alleged in the complaint and proved at trial, and, if the alleged unlawful detainer is based on default in the payment of rent, find the amount of any rent due, and the judgment shall be rendered against the tenant liable for the forcible entry, forcible detainer, or unlawful detainer for the amount of damages thus assessed, for the rent, if any, found due, and late fees if such fees are due under the lease and do not exceed $75 in total. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The landlord is not entitled to a judgment for rent unless the basis for the unlawful detainer action was nonpayment of rent.</span> The court may award statutory costs. The court may also award reasonable attorneys' fees as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.290'>59.18.290</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) When the tenant is liable for unlawful detainer after a default in the payment of rent, execution upon the judgment shall not occur until the expiration of five court days after the entry of the judgment. Before entry of a judgment or until five court days have expired after entry of the judgment, unless the tenant provides a pledge of financial assistance letter from a government or nonprofit entity, in which case the tenant has until the date of eviction, the tenant or any subtenant, or any mortgagee of the term, or other party interested in the continuance of the tenancy, may pay into court or to the landlord the amount of the rent due, any court costs incurred at the time of payment, late fees if such fees are due under the lease and do not exceed $75 in total, and attorneys' fees if awarded, in which event any judgment entered shall be satisfied and the tenant restored to his or her tenancy. If the tenant seeks to restore his or her tenancy after entry of a judgment, the tenant may tender the amount stated within the judgment as long as that amount does not exceed the amount authorized under subsection (1) of this section. If a tenant seeks to restore his or her tenancy and pay the amount set forth in this subsection with funds acquired through an emergency rental assistance program provided by a governmental or nonprofit entity, the tenant shall provide a copy of the pledge of emergency rental assistance provided from the appropriate governmental or nonprofit entity and have an opportunity to exercise such rights under this subsection, which may include a stay of judgment and provision by the landlord of documentation necessary for processing the assistance. The landlord shall accept any pledge of emergency rental assistance funds provided to the tenant from a governmental or nonprofit entity before the expiration of any pay or vacate notice for nonpayment of rent for the full amount of the rent owing under the rental agreement. The landlord shall accept any written pledge of emergency rental assistance funds provided to the tenant from a governmental or nonprofit entity after the expiration of the pay or vacate notice if the pledge will contribute to the total payment of both the amount of rent due, including any current rent, and other amounts if required under this subsection. The landlord shall suspend any court action for 14 court days after providing necessary payment information to the nonprofit or governmental entity to allow for payment of the emergency rental assistance funds.

A tenant seeking to exercise rights under this subsection shall pay an additional $50 for each time the tenant was reinstated after judgment pursuant to this subsection within the previous 12 months prior to payment.

In making this decision, the court shall consider evidence of the following factors:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The tenant's willful or intentional default or intentional failure to pay rent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Whether nonpayment of the rent was caused by exigent circumstances that were beyond the tenant's control and that are not likely to recur;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The tenant's ability to timely pay the judgment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) The tenant's payment history;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(v) Whether the tenant is otherwise in substantial compliance with the rental agreement;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vi) Hardship on the tenant if evicted; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(vii) Conduct related to other notices served within the last six months.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The burden of proof for such relief under this subsection (3) shall be on the tenant.

However, the court may grant a repayment plan with a higher monthly repayment amount, not to exceed one month's rent, as necessary to achieve repayment on the back-owed rent within six months. Following a hearing on repayment, the court shall order the issuance of a writ or the expiration of a stay if the court determines that repayment is not possible because the back-owed balance exceeds six months' rent, unless the court determines that rental assistance will be available and may satisfy the balance in a repayment period of less than six months. If the court ordered a judgment that included fees and costs, including late fees, or reserved judgment on such issues, the court shall not include such fees in the repayment plan amount. The repayment plan described in this section shall only apply to back-owed rent. If a tenant successfully repays under this section, the court shall sign an order waiving any fees and costs.

In the event payment is made as provided in (c)(ii) of this subsection for one month's rent, the court shall stay the writ of restitution ex parte without prior notice to the landlord upon the tenant filing and presenting a motion to stay with a declaration of proof of payment demonstrating full compliance with the required payment of one month's rent. Any order staying the writ of restitution under this subsection (3)(c)(iii) shall require the tenant to serve a copy of the order on the landlord by personal delivery, first-class mail, facsimile, or email if agreed to by the parties.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) If the tenant has satisfied (c)(ii) of this subsection by paying one month's rent within five court days, but defaults on a subsequent payment required by the court pursuant to this subsection (3)(c), the landlord may enforce the writ of restitution after serving a notice of default in accordance with RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.12.040'>59.12.040</a> informing the tenant that he or she has defaulted on rent due under the lease agreement or payment plan entered by the court.
