The legislature finds that agricultural land owned by Washington farmers and ranchers plays a key role in the availability of affordable food in Washington state. However, the legislature further finds that the acquisition of agricultural land by large investment and business entities, multinational nonprofit organizations, certain land trusts, and other corporate and nonprofit entities is driving local farmers and ranchers out of business while burdening Washington consumers with significant increases in food costs.

(1) The legislature finds that the practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW.
