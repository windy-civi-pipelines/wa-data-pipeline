The legislature believes that the department should be enabled to execute lease agreements with governmental entities and nonprofit organizations that can help serve these community purposes using lease terms that take into account the community benefit these leases will provide. Therefore, the legislature is establishing a framework for the department to use in developing lease agreements in this context. The legislature intends for the department to consider the authorization of these lease agreements urgent in light of the compelling needs that can be served by the leasing of certain properties under the jurisdiction of the department, and encourages the department to move forward developing the lease agreements it determines are appropriate, based on the factors provided below, as expeditiously as possible.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=47.12.120'>47.12.120</a> and 2022 c 59 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The department may rent or lease any lands, improvements, or air space above or below any lands that are held for highway purposes but are not presently needed.
