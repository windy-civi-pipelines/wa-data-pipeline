Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, the following tax relief is allowed: </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The legislature may, by appropriate legislation, provide a homestead property tax exemption for taxes levied for state purposes on property occupied as a principal residence by the individual claiming the exemption.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The homestead property tax exemption authorized under subsection (a) of this section may be in the form of a reduction of up to $250,000 of equalized assessed valuation of qualifying properties. To prevent the homestead property tax exemption from shifting the state property tax burden to higher valued principal residences and nonexempt property, the state levy or levies must be reduced as necessary to prevent the homestead property tax exemption from resulting in a higher tax rate than would have occurred in the absence of the homestead property tax exemption.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The legislature may provide for an annual increase to the maximum amount of exemption and credit provided in subsection (b) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The legislature may place other limitations and conditions upon the homestead property tax exemption as it deems proper.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the secretary of state shall cause notice of this constitutional amendment to be published at least four times during the four weeks next preceding the election in every legal newspaper in the state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
