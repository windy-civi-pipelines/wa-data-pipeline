The legislature recognizes the department of health's newborn screening program currently tests newborns for 32 rare congenital conditions through drops of blood collected within the first days and weeks of birth and funded through a one-time fee generally billed through the birthing facility. Further, the legislature recognizes that the federal recommended uniform screening panel is established and periodically updated through a science-based and deliberative review process by a national committee of experts in newborn screening and rare disease. It is the intent of the legislature that additions to the newborn screening panel be timely, efficient, and evidence-based, and that this be achieved by leveraging the recommended uniform screening panel, ensuring intra-agency coordination, requiring focused feasibility reviews, and ensuring fees collected for newborn screenings are readily available to implement the requirements under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.83'>70.83</a> RCW. Furthermore, the legislature intends to protect the ability of the public to petition for additions to the newborn screening panel outside of the recommended uniform screening panel.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.83.020'>70.83.020</a> and 2014 c 18 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It shall be the duty of the department of health to require screening tests of all newborn infants born in any setting.
