WilsonRead first time 01/31/25.Referred to Committee on Labor & Commerce.AN ACT Relating to creating a wage replacement program for certain Washington workers excluded from unemployment insurance; amending RCW 50.29.041 and 50.24.014; reenacting and amending RCW 42.56.410 and 50.29.025; adding a new chapter to Title 50 RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds and declares:(1) When unemployment insurance was established by the United States congress and the state legislature, the legislature explicitly recognized that economic insecurity caused by unemployment is the greatest hazard of our economic life that falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker, which therefore requires the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to reduce the suffering caused by unemployment to a minimum. Unemployment insurance is essential to ensure that individuals who lose income can survive and meet their basic needs during periods they are unable to find stable work.(2) Many immigrant workers, however, are not eligible for unemployment insurance and have not received any assistance from this jointly administered state and federal insurance program. RCW 50.20.098 provides that unemployment insurance benefits shall not be payable unless the individual was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or otherwise was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed. Title 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1621(d) requires that states wishing to extend benefits beyond a short list of qualified immigrants must affirmatively do so. Those ineligible to receive unemployment benefits include workers without work authorization, workers whose work authorization has expired or is awaiting renewal, and workers who recently regularized their immigration status.(3) Ineligibility for unemployment benefits has devastated immigrant communities during the pandemic economic crisis, particularly immigrants working in low-wage industries. Several of the industries that have experienced the highest rates of job loss in Washington due to the pandemic are low-wage sectors with the highest numbers of immigrant workers including the restaurant, hotel, retail, and construction industries. Economists predict large-scale permanent job loss and long-term unemployment as the effects of the pandemic are similar to the great recession of 2008. Without access to unemployment benefits among other critical safety net programs, Washington's immigrant communities face deep economic devastation for years to come. Prior to the pandemic, the poverty rate of immigrants in Washington was already high, with 18 percent of the state's immigrant residents living in poverty compared to 12 percent of United States born residents. The crisis is expected to significantly expand this disparity.(4) The fiscal policy institute reports that Washington employers have contributed nearly $400,000,000 to national and state unemployment trust funds between the years 2010-2019 on behalf of undocumented workers.(5) To support the survival of Washington's immigrant workers and families during periods of crisis, particularly low-income households, and to provide the safety net that United States born Washington residents can access, the legislature intends to establish a weekly wage replacement state program similar to the state and federal unemployment insurance program for workers who are unemployed and not eligible for the state and federal unemployment insurance.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

The division shall be carried to the second decimal place with the remaining fraction disregarded unless it amounts to five hundredths or more, in which case the second decimal place shall be rounded to the next higher digit. The flat social cost factor shall be expressed as a percentage.(B)(I) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide more than ten months of unemployment benefits, the commissioner shall calculate the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date by reducing the total social cost by the dollar amount that represents the number of months for which the balance in the unemployment compensation fund on the cut-off date will provide benefits above ten months and dividing the result by the total taxable payroll. However, the calculation under this subsection (1)(b)(i)(B) for a rate year may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than four-tenths lower than the calculation under (b)(i)(A) of this subsection for that rate year. For rate year 2011 and thereafter, the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent except for rate year 2021 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2022 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2023 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than seven-tenths percent, for rate year 2024 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than eighty-five one-hundredths percent, and for rate year 2025 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than nine-tenths percent.(II) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide ten months of unemployment benefits or less, the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date may not increase by more than fifty percent over the previous rate year or may not exceed one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent, whichever is greater.(III) For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), the commissioner shall determine the number of months of unemployment benefits in the unemployment compensation fund using the benefit cost rate for the average of the three highest calendar benefit cost rates in the twenty consecutive completed calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date or a period of consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date that includes three recessions, if longer.(C) The minimum flat social cost factor calculated under this subsection (1)(b) shall be six-tenths of one percent, except that if the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide:(I) At least ten months but less than eleven months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be five-tenths of one percent; or(II) At least eleven months but less than twelve months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be forty-five hundredths of one percent; or(III) At least twelve months but less than thirteen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be four-tenths of one percent;

ï»¿S-0852.4SENATE BILL 5626State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionBySenators SaldaÃ±a, Lovelett, Valdez, Cortes, Alvarado, Orwall, Kauffman, Slatter, Dhingra, Frame, Hasegawa, Nobles, Stanford, and C. WilsonRead first time 01/31/25.Referred to Committee on Labor & Commerce.AN ACT Relating to creating a wage replacement program for certain Washington workers excluded from unemployment insurance; amending RCW 50.29.041 and 50.24.014; reenacting and amending RCW 42.56.410 and 50.29.025; adding a new chapter to Title 50 RCW; creating a new section; and prescribing penalties.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds and declares:(1) When unemployment insurance was established by the United States congress and the state legislature, the legislature explicitly recognized that economic insecurity caused by unemployment is the greatest hazard of our economic life that falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker, which therefore requires the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to reduce the suffering caused by unemployment to a minimum. Unemployment insurance is essential to ensure that individuals who lose income can survive and meet their basic needs during periods they are unable to find stable work.(2) Many immigrant workers, however, are not eligible for unemployment insurance and have not received any assistance from this jointly administered state and federal insurance program. RCW 50.20.098 provides that unemployment insurance benefits shall not be payable unless the individual was lawfully admitted for permanent residence, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or otherwise was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed. Title 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1621(d) requires that states wishing to extend benefits beyond a short list of qualified immigrants must affirmatively do so. Those ineligible to receive unemployment benefits include workers without work authorization, workers whose work authorization has expired or is awaiting renewal, and workers who recently regularized their immigration status.(3) Ineligibility for unemployment benefits has devastated immigrant communities during the pandemic economic crisis, particularly immigrants working in low-wage industries. Several of the industries that have experienced the highest rates of job loss in Washington due to the pandemic are low-wage sectors with the highest numbers of immigrant workers including the restaurant, hotel, retail, and construction industries. Economists predict large-scale permanent job loss and long-term unemployment as the effects of the pandemic are similar to the great recession of 2008. Without access to unemployment benefits among other critical safety net programs, Washington's immigrant communities face deep economic devastation for years to come. Prior to the pandemic, the poverty rate of immigrants in Washington was already high, with 18 percent of the state's immigrant residents living in poverty compared to 12 percent of United States born residents. The crisis is expected to significantly expand this disparity.(4) The fiscal policy institute reports that Washington employers have contributed nearly $400,000,000 to national and state unemployment trust funds between the years 2010-2019 on behalf of undocumented workers.(5) To support the survival of Washington's immigrant workers and families during periods of crisis, particularly low-income households, and to provide the safety net that United States born Washington residents can access, the legislature intends to establish a weekly wage replacement state program similar to the state and federal unemployment insurance program for workers who are unemployed and not eligible for the state and federal unemployment insurance.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise. In addition, the definitions in chapter 50.04 RCW apply, except as otherwise provided in this section.(1) "Application for initial determination" has the meaning provided in RCW 50.20.140.(2) "Benefit" or "benefits" means the compensation payable to a claimant, as provided in either this title or this chapter with respect to the claimant's unemployment.(3) "Claimant" means an individual applying for benefits under this chapter.(4) "Department" means the employment security department.(5)(a) "Employment" has the meaning provided in RCW 50.04.100, subject to the provisions of RCW 50.04.110, 50.04.120 through 50.04.205, and 50.04.210 through 50.04.280. The provisions of RCW 50.04.206 do not apply to the definition of "employment" for this chapter.(b) "Employment" does not include service that is performed by a nonresident for the period the nonresident is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F), (H)(ii), (H)(iii), or (J) of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1101(a)(15) of the immigration and nationality act, as amended as of the effective date of this section, and that is performed to carry out the purpose specified in the applicable subparagraph of the immigration and nationality act.(6)(a) "Resident of the state of Washington" means a claimant who takes actions indicating they intend to live in Washington state on more than a temporary or transient basis throughout the duration of receiving benefits under this chapter. Under this chapter, a claimant is a resident of the state of Washington if the claimant:(i) Maintains a residence in Washington for personal use with a utility bill showing their full name and Washington state address;(ii) Lives in a motor home or vessel that is not permanently attached to any real property if the claimant previously lived in this state and does not have a permanent residence in any other state;(iii) Is attending school in this state and paying tuition as a Washington resident, is a custodial parent with a child attending a public school in this state, or has correspondence from a school in this state showing their full name and Washington state address;(iv) Has a Washington state identification card showing their full name and Washington state address;(v) Has a current library card issued in this state;(vi) Has correspondence from a community or faith-based organization in this state showing their full name and Washington state address; or(vii) Has a medical document showing their full name and Washington state address.(b) The actions and documentation outlined in this subsection (6) are a nonexhaustive list, and the third-party administrator may adopt additional methods by which a claimant may prove they are a resident of the state of Washington.(7) "Third-party administrator" means an entity with which the department contracts to administer payments to eligible individuals under this chapter.(8) "Week of unemployment" means any week during which a claimant, including a self-employed claimant:(a) Performs no services and with respect to which no remuneration is payable to the claimant; or(b) Performs less than full-time work if the remuneration payable to the claimant with respect to such week is less than one and one-third times the individual's weekly benefit amount plus $5.00.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3. (1) The Washington wage replacement account is created in the custody of the state treasurer. Revenues to the account must consist of appropriations and transfers by the legislature and all other funding directed for deposit into the account. Expenditures from the account may be used only for providing benefits under this chapter to eligible and qualified claimants, contracting with community-based organizations to notify individuals who may be eligible for benefits under this chapter, administration of the advisory committee of this act, the department's administrative costs, and third-party administrators under this chapter.

At a minimum, the third-party administrator must have experience building and operating financial benefit systems that are proven to be accessible and responsive to the target population and demonstrated mechanisms to prevent disclosure of confidential or private information. The department may adopt rules for selecting and replacing the third-party administrator.(b) Each quarter, to the extent allowed by the United States department of labor, employment and training administration, the department shall allocate the money in the wage replacement account to one or more third-party administrators for the purpose of providing benefits to eligible and qualified claimants and for contracting with community-based organizations to notify individuals who may be eligible for this program. (c) The third-party administrator selected pursuant to (a) of this subsection shall, within one year after the contract is awarded after the effective date of this section: (i) Contract with community-based organizations to provide outreach to unemployed individuals who may be eligible for benefits under this chapter;(ii) Screen each applicant for benefits to determine if the applicant is an eligible individual; (iii) Pay benefits to eligible individuals; and (iv) Establish an appeal process for benefit denials, suspensions, or terminations.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 4.

The department must provide the report required in RCW 43.18A.020.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 5.

RCW 50.29.025 and 2022 c 61 s 1 and 2022 c 17 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:(1) The contribution rate for each employer subject to contributions under RCW 50.24.010 shall be the sum of the array calculation factor rate and the graduated social cost factor rate determined under this subsection((, and the solvency surcharge determined under RCW 50.29.041, if any)).(a) The array calculation factor rate shall be determined as follows:(i) An array shall be prepared, listing all qualified employers in ascending order of their benefit ratios. The array shall show for each qualified employer: (A) Identification number; (B) benefit ratio; and (C) taxable payrolls for the four consecutive calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date and reported to the employment security department by the cut-off date.(ii) Each employer in the array shall be assigned to one of forty rate classes according to his or her benefit ratio as follows, and, except as provided in RCW 50.29.026, the array calculation factor rate for each employer in the array shall be the rate specified in the rate class to which the employer has been assigned:Benefit RatioRateClassRate(percent)At leastLess thanÂ 0.00000110.000.0000010.00125020.110.0012500.00250030.220.0025000.00375040.330.0037500.00500050.430.0050000.00625060.540.0062500.00750070.650.0075000.00875080.760.0087500.01000090.880.0100000.011250101.010.0112500.012500111.140.0125000.013750121.280.0137500.015000131.410.0150000.016250141.540.0162500.017500151.670.0175000.018750161.800.0187500.020000171.940.0200000.021250182.070.0212500.022500192.200.0225000.023750202.380.0237500.025000212.500.0250000.026250222.630.0262500.027500232.750.0275000.028750242.880.0287500.030000253.000.0300000.031250263.130.0312500.032500273.250.0325000.033750283.380.0337500.035000293.500.0350000.036250303.630.0362500.037500313.750.0375000.040000324.000.0400000.042500334.250.0425000.045000344.500.0450000.047500354.750.0475000.050000365.000.0500000.052500375.150.0525000.055000385.250.0550000.057500395.300.057500Â 405.40(b) The graduated social cost factor rate shall be determined as follows:(i)(A) Except as provided in (b)(i)(B) and (C) of this subsection, the commissioner shall calculate the flat social cost factor for a rate year by dividing the total social cost by the total taxable payroll. The division shall be carried to the second decimal place with the remaining fraction disregarded unless it amounts to five hundredths or more, in which case the second decimal place shall be rounded to the next higher digit. The flat social cost factor shall be expressed as a percentage.(B)(I) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide more than ten months of unemployment benefits, the commissioner shall calculate the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date by reducing the total social cost by the dollar amount that represents the number of months for which the balance in the unemployment compensation fund on the cut-off date will provide benefits above ten months and dividing the result by the total taxable payroll. However, the calculation under this subsection (1)(b)(i)(B) for a rate year may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than four-tenths lower than the calculation under (b)(i)(A) of this subsection for that rate year. For rate year 2011 and thereafter, the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent except for rate year 2021 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2022 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than five-tenths percent, for rate year 2023 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than seven-tenths percent, for rate year 2024 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than eighty-five one-hundredths percent, and for rate year 2025 the calculation may not result in a flat social cost factor that is more than nine-tenths percent.(II) If, on the cut-off date, the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide ten months of unemployment benefits or less, the flat social cost factor for the rate year immediately following the cut-off date may not increase by more than fifty percent over the previous rate year or may not exceed one and twenty-two one-hundredths percent, whichever is greater.(III) For the purposes of this subsection (1)(b), the commissioner shall determine the number of months of unemployment benefits in the unemployment compensation fund using the benefit cost rate for the average of the three highest calendar benefit cost rates in the twenty consecutive completed calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date or a period of consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the cut-off date that includes three recessions, if longer.(C) The minimum flat social cost factor calculated under this subsection (1)(b) shall be six-tenths of one percent, except that if the balance in the unemployment compensation fund is determined by the commissioner to be an amount that will provide:(I) At least ten months but less than eleven months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be five-tenths of one percent; or(II) At least eleven months but less than twelve months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be forty-five hundredths of one percent; or(III) At least twelve months but less than thirteen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be four-tenths of one percent; or(IV) At least thirteen months but less than fifteen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be thirty-five hundredths of one percent; or(V) At least fifteen months but less than seventeen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be twenty-five hundredths of one percent; or(VI) At least seventeen months but less than eighteen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be fifteen hundredths of one percent; or(VII) At least eighteen months of unemployment benefits, the minimum shall be fifteen hundredths of one percent through rate year 2011 and shall be zero thereafter.(ii) The graduated social cost factor rate for each employer in the array is the flat social cost factor multiplied by the percentage specified as follows for the rate class to which the employer has been assigned in (a)(ii) of this subsection, except that the sum of an employer's array calculation factor rate and the graduated social cost factor rate may not exceed six percent or, for employers whose North American industry classification system code is within "111," "112," "1141," "115," "3114," "3117," "42448," or "49312," may not exceed five and four-tenths percent:(A) Rate class 1 - 40 percent;(B) Rate class 2 - 44 percent;(C) Rate class 3 - 48 percent;(D) Rate class 4 - 52 percent;(E) Rate class 5 - 56 percent;(F) Rate class 6 - 60 percent;(G) Rate class 7 - 64 percent;(H) Rate class 8 - 68 percent;(I) Rate class 9 - 72 percent;(J) Rate class 10 - 76 percent;(K) Rate class 11 - 80 percent;(L) Rate class 12 - 84 percent;(M) Rate class 13 - 88 percent;(N) Rate class 14 - 92 percent;(O) Rate class 15 - 96 percent;(P) Rate class 16 - 100 percent;(Q) Rate class 17 - 104 percent;(R) Rate class 18 - 108 percent;(S) Rate class 19 - 112 percent;(T) Rate class 20 - 116 percent; and(U) Rate classes 21 through 40 - 120 percent.(iii) For rate year 2023, for any employer with 10 or fewer employees as reported on the employer's fourth quarter report to the department for 2021 and whose rate class is greater than rate class 7, the employer's rate class, only for purposes of the rate classes in (b)(ii)(A) through (U) of this subsection (1), is rate class 7.(iv) For the purposes of this section:(A) "Total social cost" means the amount calculated by subtracting the array calculation factor contributions paid by all employers with respect to the four consecutive calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date and paid to the employment security department by the cut-off date from the total unemployment benefits paid to claimants in the same four consecutive calendar quarters.(B) "Total taxable payroll" means the total amount of wages subject to tax, as determined under RCW 50.24.010, for all employers in the four consecutive calendar quarters immediately preceding the computation date and reported to the employment security department by the cut-off date.(c) For employers who do not meet the definition of "qualified employer" by reason of failure to pay contributions when due:(i)(A) For an employer who does not enter into an approved agency-deferred payment contract as described in (c)(i)(B) or (C) of this subsection, the array calculation factor rate shall be the rate it would have been if the employer had not been delinquent in payment plus an additional one percent or, if the employer is delinquent in payment for a second or more consecutive year, an additional two percent;(B) For an employer who enters an approved agency-deferred payment contract by September 30th of the previous rate year, the array calculation factor rate shall be the rate it would have been if the employer had not been delinquent in payment;(C) For an employer who enters an approved agency-deferred payment contract after September 30th of the previous rate year, but within thirty days of the date the department sent its first tax rate notice, the array calculation factor rate shall be the rate it would have been had the employer not been delinquent in payment plus an additional one-half of one percent or, if the employer is delinquent in payment for a second or more consecutive year, an additional one and one-half percent;(D) For an employer who enters an approved agency-deferred payment contract as described in (c)(i)(B) or (C) of this subsection, but who fails to make any one of the succeeding deferred payments or fails to submit any succeeding tax report and payment in a timely manner, the array calculation factor rate shall immediately revert to the applicable array calculation factor rate under (c)(i)(A) of this subsection; and(ii) The social cost factor rate shall be the social cost factor rate assigned to rate class 40 under (b)(ii) of this subsection.(d) For all other employers not qualified to be in the array:(i) The array calculation factor rate shall be a rate equal to the average industry array calculation factor rate as determined by the commissioner, multiplied by the history factor, but not less than one percent or more than the array calculation factor rate in rate class 40;(ii) The social cost factor rate shall be a rate equal to the average industry social cost factor rate as determined by the commissioner, multiplied by the history factor, but not more than the social cost factor rate assigned to rate class 40 under (b)(ii) of this subsection; and(iii) The history factor shall be based on the total amounts of benefits charged and contributions paid in the three fiscal years ending prior to the computation date by employers not qualified to be in the array, other than employers in (c) of this subsection, who were first subject to contributions in the calendar year ending three years prior to the computation date. The commissioner shall calculate the history ratio by dividing the total amount of benefits charged by the total amount of contributions paid in this three-year period by these employers. The division shall be carried to the second decimal place with the remaining fraction disregarded unless it amounts to five one-hundredths or more, in which case the second decimal place shall be rounded to the next higher digit. The commissioner shall determine the history factor according to the history ratio as follows:HistoryRatioÂ HistoryFactor(percent)Â At leastLess thanÂ (A)Â .9590(B).951.05100(C)1.05Â 115(2) Assignment of employers by the commissioner to industrial classification, for purposes of this section, shall be in accordance with established classification practices found in the North American industry classification system code.Sec. 21.
