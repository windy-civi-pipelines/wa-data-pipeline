Students are on campus every day using services and experiencing aspects of the institution that board members may only see on paper, providing a unique and valuable perspective that should not be overlooked.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Students serving on governing boards of institutions of higher education have proven effective in Washington and in over 30 other states. For nearly 30 years, students at Washington's four-year institutions of higher education have served as voting members on the board of trustees and regents. Students also serve with voting rights on both the Washington student achievement council and the workforce education investment accountability and oversight board. These opportunities have provided greater depth in board deliberations and a well-educated conduit for students to voice ideas and concerns.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The student perspective at community colleges also brings the board closer to their community. Student populations at community colleges are the most diverse of any institution of higher education in the state. Being on campus and in class every day, students are exposed to a more diverse group than any member of the board representing any one group of the community. Student positions on governing boards are also a valuable tool for developing leadership through experiential learning. Student members learn processes of institutional governance, become involved in campus projects, analyze policy proposals, and participate in board discussions and decision making. While some student leaders are given the opportunity to report directly to the board, this is vastly different from having a right to discussion and the opportunity to vote on matters important to the student body.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">It is the intent of the legislature to enhance community college governance by fostering a more dynamic relationship between students and institutions through the encouragement of student participation in policy development and decision making at the district and state level.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.50.100'>28B.50.100</a> and 2013 c 23 s 58 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(1)</span> There is hereby created a board of trustees for each college district as set forth in this chapter.
