It is the intent of the legislature to keep the public safe when on the road. Nationwide, 29 percent of all crash fatalities occurred in speed-related crashes in 2022. In 2023, more than 30 percent of fatal crashes involved speeding on Washington roads.

By leveraging technology to enable individuals to continue driving and prevent speeding, the legislature intends to enhance road safety to promote safer driving habits and keep the public safe.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 46.04 RCW to read as follows:"Excessive speeding" means traveling at 20 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 46.04 RCW to read as follows:"Intelligent speed assistance device" means a technical device designed to be installed within a motor vehicle to actively monitor and prevent the driver from exceeding a preset limit.

It is the intent of the legislature to keep the public safe when on the road. Nationwide, 29 percent of all crash fatalities occurred in speed-related crashes in 2022. In 2023, more than 30 percent of fatal crashes involved speeding on Washington roads. Speeding continues to be a component of traffic deaths, and law enforcement is increasingly dealing with more speed-related incidents. The legislature finds that all Washington drivers are at risk when speeding is involved, and solutions to change public behavior are needed.Additionally, according to the American motor vehicle administration, more than 70 percent of people with suspended licenses continue to drive during the suspension period. By leveraging technology to enable individuals to continue driving and prevent speeding, the legislature intends to enhance road safety to promote safer driving habits and keep the public safe.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 46.04 RCW to read as follows:"Excessive speeding" means traveling at 20 miles per hour or greater in excess of the posted speed limit.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 3. A new section is added to chapter 46.04 RCW to read as follows:"Intelligent speed assistance device" means a technical device designed to be installed within a motor vehicle to actively monitor and prevent the driver from exceeding a preset limit.

The person must provide the department with a declaration pursuant to chapter 5.50 RCW from his or her employer stating that the person's employment requires the person to operate a vehicle owned by the employer or other persons during working hours. When the department receives a declaration under this subsection, it shall attach or imprint a notation on the person's driving record stating that the employer exemption applies.(b) The employer exemption does not apply when the employer's vehicle is assigned exclusively to the restricted driver and used solely for commuting to and from employment.(5) Unless costs are waived by the intelligent speed assistance device company or the person is indigent under RCW 10.101.010, a person subject to the requirements of subsection (1) of this section shall pay the costs of installing, removing, and leasing the intelligent speed assistance device and shall pay an additional fee of $21 per month. Payments must be made directly to the intelligent speed assistance device company. The company shall remit the additional fee to the department to be deposited into the intelligent speed assistance device revolving account under section 8 of this act, except that the company may retain 25 cents per month of the additional fee to cover the expenses associated with administering the fee. The department may waive the monthly fee if the person is indigent under RCW 10.101.010.(6) For a person restricted under this section who is residing outside of the state of Washington, the department may accept verification of installation of an intelligent speed assistance device by an intelligent speed assistance device company authorized to do business in the jurisdiction or within a 75 mile radius of the jurisdiction in which the person resides, provided the device meets any applicable requirements of that jurisdiction.

The provisions of this subsection do not apply if the starting of a motor vehicle, or the request to start a motor vehicle, equipped with an intelligent speed assistance device is done for the purpose of safety or mechanical repair of the device or the vehicle and the person subject to the court order does not operate the vehicle.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 7. A new section is added to chapter 46.61 RCW to read as follows:When sentencing a person convicted of any criminal offense under this chapter or a violation of any other provision of law that constitutes a misdemeanor, gross misdemeanor, or felony, the court may impose, as a condition of probation, a requirement regarding the installation and use of a functioning intelligent speed assistance device installed on all motor vehicles operated by the person.

Prior to reinstatement of a license, the person must complete a safe driving course as recommended by the department. During the period of probation, and subject to the requirements of (b) of this subsection, the person must not be convicted of any additional traffic infractions for moving violations. Any traffic infraction for a moving violation committed during the period of probation shall result in an additional 30-day suspension to run consecutively with any suspension already being served.(b)(i) During the first 120 days of the period of probation, following the period of suspension for an accumulation of moving violations under this section in which one or more of the violations is for excessive speeding, as defined in section 2 of this act, the person may not operate a vehicle upon which a properly functioning intelligent speed assistance device has not been installed.
