The following types of petitions for a protection order may be filed:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A petition for a domestic violence protection order, which must allege the existence of domestic violence committed against the petitioner or petitioners by an intimate partner or a family or household member. The petitioner may petition for relief on behalf of himself or herself and on behalf of family or household members who are minors or vulnerable adults. A petition for a domestic violence protection order must specify whether the petitioner and the respondent are intimate partners or family or household members. A petitioner who has been sexually assaulted or stalked by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a sexual assault protection order or a stalking protection order.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A petition for a sexual assault protection order, which must allege the existence of nonconsensual sexual conduct, nonconsensual sexual penetration, or commercial sexual exploitation that was committed against the petitioner by the respondent. A petitioner who has been sexually assaulted by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a sexual assault protection order. A single incident of nonconsensual sexual conduct or nonconsensual sexual penetration is sufficient grounds for a petition for a sexual assault protection order. The petitioner may petition for a sexual assault protection order on behalf of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Himself or herself;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A petition for a stalking protection order, which must allege the existence of stalking committed against the petitioner or petitioners by the respondent. A petitioner who has been stalked by an intimate partner or a family or household member should, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence protection order, rather than a stalking protection order. The petitioner may petition for a stalking protection order on behalf of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Himself or herself;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A petition for a vulnerable adult protection order, which must allege that the petitioner, or person on whose behalf the petition is brought, is a vulnerable adult and that the petitioner, or person on whose behalf the petition is brought, has been abandoned, abused, financially exploited, or neglected, or is threatened with abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect, by the respondent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) A petition for an extreme risk protection order, which must allege that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in the respondent's custody or control, purchasing, possessing, accessing, receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive, a firearm. The petition must also identify information the petitioner is able to provide about the firearms, such as the number, types, and locations of any firearms the petitioner believes to be in the respondent's current ownership, possession, custody, access, or control. A petition for an extreme risk protection order may be filed by (i) an intimate partner or a family or household member of the respondent; or (ii) a law enforcement agency.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) A petition for an antiharassment protection order, which must allege the existence of unlawful harassment committed against the petitioner or petitioners by the respondent. If a petitioner is seeking relief based on domestic violence, nonconsensual sexual conduct, nonconsensual sexual penetration, or stalking, the petitioner may, but is not required to, seek a domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking protection order, rather than an antiharassment order. The petitioner may petition for an antiharassment protection order on behalf of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Himself or herself;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) A minor child, where the petitioner is the parent, legal guardian, or custodian;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) A vulnerable adult, where the petitioner is an interested person; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iv) Any other adult for whom the petitioner demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the petitioner is interested in the adult's well-being, the court's intervention is necessary, and the adult cannot file the petition because of age, disability, health, or inaccessibility.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(g)(i) A petition for an impaired driving protection order, which must allege that the respondent poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by driving or having physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</span></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">(ii) The petition must include any information known to the petitioner regarding the respondent's history of driving or having physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

He or she may also petition on behalf of a family or household member who is a minor if chosen by the minor and capable of pursuing the minor's stated interest in the action.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) A person under 15 years of age who is seeking relief under this chapter is required to seek relief by a person authorized as a petitioner under this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) If a petition for a protection order is filed by an interested person, the affidavit or declaration must also include a statement of why the petitioner qualifies as an interested person.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) A petition for any type of protection order must not be dismissed or denied on the basis that the conduct alleged by the petitioner would meet the criteria for the issuance of another type of protection order. If a petition meets the criteria for a different type of protection order other than the one sought by the petitioner, the court shall consider the petitioner's preference, and enter a temporary protection order or set the matter for a hearing as appropriate under the law. The court's decision on the appropriate type of order shall not be premised on alleviating any potential stigma on the respondent.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) The protection order petition must contain a section where the petitioner, regardless of petition type, may request specific relief provided for in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105.310'>7.105.310</a> that the petitioner seeks for himself or herself or for family or household members who are minors. The totality of selected relief, and any other relief the court deems appropriate for the petitioner, or family or household members who are minors, must be considered at the time of entry of temporary protection orders and at the time of entry of full protection orders.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) If a court reviewing the petition for a protection order or a request for a temporary protection order determines that the petition was not filed in the correct court, the court shall enter findings establishing the correct court, and direct the clerk to transfer the petition to the correct court and to provide notice of the transfer to all parties who have appeared.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) Upon filing a petition for a protection order, the petitioner may request that the court enter an ex parte temporary protection order and an order to surrender and prohibit weapons without notice until a hearing on a full protection order may be held. When requested, there shall be a rebuttable presumption to include the petitioner's minor children as protected parties in the ex parte temporary domestic violence protection order until the full hearing to reduce the risk of harm to children during periods of heightened risk, unless there is good cause not to include the minor children. If the court denies the petitioner's request to include the minor children, the court shall make written findings why the children should not be included, pending the full hearing. An ex parte temporary protection order shall be effective for a fixed period of time and shall be issued initially for a period not to exceed 14 days, which may be extended for good cause.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 4.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.105.115'>7.105.115</a> and 2022 c 268 s 7 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) By December 30, 2022, the administrative office of the courts shall:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Develop and distribute standard forms for petitions and orders issued under this chapter, and facilitate the use of online forms for electronic filings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) For all protection orders except extreme risk protection orders <span style="text-decoration:underline;">and impaired driving protection orders</span>, the protection order must include, in a conspicuous location, a notice of criminal penalties resulting from a violation of the order, and the following statement: "You can be arrested even if the protected person or persons invite or allow you to violate the order.
