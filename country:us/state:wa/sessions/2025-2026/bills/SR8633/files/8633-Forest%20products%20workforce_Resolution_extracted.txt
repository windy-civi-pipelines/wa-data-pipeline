Wilson, King, MacEwen, Muzzall, Short, Torres, Schoesler, Boehnke, Harris, Lovelett, Wagoner, Fortunato, and HasegawaWHEREAS, Washington's forests are an essential part of the state's history, culture, economy, and environment, covering 22 million acres of the state; andWHEREAS, Forests purify the air we breathe and provide clean water to our communities by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide, and they provide countless other benefits, including fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, scenic beauty, local renewable energy, and wood, an energy efficient green building material; andWHEREAS, Forests products play a critical role in combating climate change due to the natural process of photosynthesis where trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, release oxygen into the atmosphere and capture carbon which is stored in wood products for the life of the product; andWHEREAS, From 2001 to 2021, state and private forest landowners in Washington removed nearly 9,200 fish passage barriers and opened up nearly 6,500 miles of historic fish habitat as part of their commitment to implementing the Forest and Fish Law; andWHEREAS, The production of wood, paper, and energy products from the forest supports more than 42,000 direct jobs and another 60,000 forest sector related jobs, paying wages of nearly $6 billion each year; which provide family-wage employment opportunities, sustain rural economies, and strengthen local communities; andWHEREAS, Products harvested from sustainably managed forests are renewable, recyclable, biodegradable, and sustainable, an essential part of our green economy that continues to grow and innovate through a skilled workforce dedicated to responsible forestry practices and advanced manufacturing; andWHEREAS, In the face of increased threats to our forests including diseases, insects, droughts, and wildfires, we need to increase the resilience and health of our state's forests and preserve their key role in mitigating climate change; andWHEREAS, Washington's integrated forest products sector and the workers, mills, logging contractors, and forestry professionals are essential to efforts to restore and maintain the health of forests, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and make forests more resilient to drought and climate change; and Â WHEREAS, Washington's pulp and paper mills are state and federally recognized essential businesses that keep vital paper products available in the Pacific Northwest across the United States and globally. Washington's mills provide approximately 7,500 predominantly union-backed, family-wage jobs in some of Washington's more rural, economically distressed communities providing a 3:1 job multiplier. Mills are often the single largest employers and taxpayers in these counties, providing critical tax funding for police, fire, and emergency medical services, as well as funding for local school districts; andWHEREAS, Washington Forest Products Day at the legislature takes place on April 9, 2025, when legislators will visit with individuals from across the state representing the diverse nature of Washington's forest products industry, including workers who help drive the economy forward while advocating for responsible policies that protect both jobs and the environment;NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the Senate acknowledge and honorÂ the workforce and industry professionals whose work within this important industry has contributed much toÂ theÂ strength and vitality of our economy,Â our environment, theÂ character of our communities, andÂ theÂ general well-being of our citizens.I, Sarah Bannister, Secretary of the Senate,do hereby certify that this is a true andcorrect copy of Senate Resolution 8633,adopted by the SenateApril 9, 2025SARAH BANNISTERSecretary of the Senate
