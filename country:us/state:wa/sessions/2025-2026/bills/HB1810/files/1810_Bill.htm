A major seismic event will result in loss of life and injury due to structural collapse. The state has an 86 percent chance of experiencing a damaging earthquake between now and the next 50 years. A damaging earthquake will happen during our lifetime, and we are unprepared. The seismic retrofit of collapse-prone buildings is critical for ensuring the safety of our citizens and reducing economic disruption. Unreinforced masonry buildings, classic red brick buildings of common construction prior to World War II, were built for their fire resistance and are at risk of collapse in an earthquake due to their lack of reinforcing steel and inadequate connections. A full or partial collapse of these structures is significantly reduced by conducting seismic retrofits, bracing parapets, and strengthening connections between the floors, walls, and roof.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that supporting the identification and earthquake retrofit of unreinforced masonry buildings will increase public safety in the event of an earthquake, reducing deaths, injuries, property damages, displacement, and economic disruption.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that financial resources are needed to assist owners of unreinforced masonry buildings in conducting these lifesaving earthquake retrofits. Local jurisdictions have been unable to mandate the retrofit of these vulnerable structures, citing the economic unviability it poses for building owners who will be forced to pass costs along to tenants, decreasing the already limited stock of affordable housing.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to support public safety, earthquake readiness, and affordable housing by identifying feasible opportunities to reduce the financial burden associated with conducting seismic retrofits of unreinforced masonry buildings.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the department of commerce must conduct a study regarding financial incentives to reduce the financial burden associated with the seismic retrofit of unreinforced masonry buildings.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The study must, at a minimum, include impact analysis and policy recommendations for:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The modification and expansion of the special valuation tax;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The expansion of current use taxation;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Opportunities for time-limited exemptions under state property tax, excise tax, sales tax, business and occupation tax, or other tax structures;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) The use of valuation of special assessments and assessment zones; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) The identification of financial incentives for tax-exempt entities, such as schools, nonprofits, and religious organizations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The department of commerce must request input from the state association of county assessors, American institute of architects Washington chapter, structural engineers association of Washington, the department of revenue, and the joint legislative audit and review committee.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The department of commerce must submit a preliminary report on the outcomes of the completed study to the appropriate committees of the legislature by June 30, 2026, and a final report must be submitted by September 1, 2026.
