VANCE, THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">We, your Memorialists, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Washington, in legislative session assembled, respectfully represent and petition as follows:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The United States Army Corps of Engineers was authorized to construct, operate, and maintain four dams on the lower Snake River for navigation, hydropower, fish and wildlife conservation, and recreation; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is responsible for marketing and transmitting the hydroelectric power generated by the dams on the lower Snake River; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The lower Snake River dams' electricity output accounts for a significant percentage of BPA's peaking capacity, according to BPA; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The electricity produced by the lower Snake River dams is essential to meeting the goals set forth in Washington's Clean Energy Transformation Act; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The lower Snake River dams provide for supplies of water that are used for irrigating vast tracts of land in Washington, thereby supporting the state's critical agricultural sector; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The lower Snake River dams facilitate the transport of an average of 4,200,000 short tons of commodities, including exports, each year; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, Breaching the lower Snake River dams would eliminate all barge navigation between the Tri-Cities and Clarkston, causing the transportation of commodities to shift to rail and trucking networks; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, Barging on the Snake River is the most efficient and environmentally friendly mode of commodity transportation because a typical four-barge tow can move the same amount of cargo as 140 railcars or 538 semi-trucks; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The flatwater reservoirs and locks system resulting from the lower Snake River dams provides a diverse range of recreational opportunities and enables cruise boats to navigate between Tri-Cities and Clarkston; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, Continuous configuration and operations improvements, including enhanced fish passage, have led to progressively higher salmon and steelhead counts at the dams over time; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The federal agency responsible for operating the dams published a Record of Decision in 2020 identifying a preferred alternative operation strategy that would benefit fish without breaching the four lower Snake River dams; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, Breaching any dam on the lower Snake River would severely diminish hydroelectric power generation, irrigation, navigation, recreation, agriculture, tourism, and fish and wildlife benefits the dams currently provide to the people of Washington; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, S.182, "A bill to provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes," also known as the Northwest Energy Security Act, was recently introduced in the United States Senate; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The Northwest Energy Security Act directs that the Federal Columbia River Power System, which includes the lower Snake River dams, must be operated in a manner consistent with the 2020 Record of Decision, also known as the Supplemental Opinion; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The Northwest Energy Security Act prohibits any structural modification, action, study, or engineering plan, that restricts electrical generation at any Federal Columbia River Power System hydroelectric dam, or that limits navigation on the Snake River in Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, unless such proposal is specifically and expressly authorized by a later-enacted federal statute; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">WHEREAS, The Washington State Legislature recognizes the importance of the lower Snake River dams and the entire Federal Columbia River Power System for the security and prosperity of the state and expresses its concern that breaching any dam in the system will be to the detriment of the State of Washington;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">NOW, THEREFORE, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that you pass and approve S.182, the Northwest Energy Security Act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">BE IT RESOLVED, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Donald J.
