Memory care, however, is commonly understood to be a form of specialized care for people living with progressive memory loss or dementia. The term is most often applied to assisted living communities or other residential settings that offer specialized services and a specially designed environment that accommodates the needs of this population;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) A growing number of assisted living facilities use memory care in their names or their service descriptions and advertise themselves as providing memory care, Alzheimer's care, or dementia care. An informal study performed by the dementia action collaborative in 2021 found that there are approximately 237 assisted living facilities in Washington that advertise themselves as offering memory care or specialized dementia care, and that exact terminology and related available services varied. The use of the term "memory care" may mean that the whole building is devoted to the care of people living with dementia or that they offer a special unit or wing devoted solely to memory care; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The lack of a standard definition for memory care has resulted in differing physical environments and services from one facility to another. This situation makes it difficult for consumers and family members who are seeking or receiving care to understand the services and staffing currently offered and that can be expected as needs change over time.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The legislature intends to create a memory care facility certification for licensed assisted living facilities, managed by the department of social and health services, to create a more standardized definition of memory care in Washington and help consumers make informed choices about receiving memory care services in assisted living facilities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.20'>18.20</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) After July 1, 2026, a person may not operate or maintain a memory care facility or memory care unit within this state without becoming certified under this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) To become certified by the department as a memory care facility or memory care unit, a licensed assisted living facility must:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Have a valid, current license to operate the assisted living facility, as required under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.20.030'>18.20.030</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Not have a pattern of any of the following uncorrected or recurring significant enforcement actions prior to the date of application:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Citations issued in areas related to resident harm or serious risk of harm, or actions or inactions resulting in serious disregard for resident health, safety, or deterioration of quality of care; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Civil fines based on the department's determination of moderate or serious severity;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Not have a stop placement, or any conditions on a license related to resident care or any license revocation or summary suspension actions prior to the date of application;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Have permanent infrastructure that considers the specialized needs of residents with dementia including elements intended to prevent elopement;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Have a staffing plan that provides staff levels in the memory care unit that is adequate to respond to the assessed sleeping and waking patterns and needs of residents, including awake staff 24 hours per day at a level that is adequate to respond to the needs of residents.

The department may approve readmission of a resident to the facility from a hospital or nursing home during the stop placement or limited stop placement. The department shall terminate the stop placement or limited stop placement when: (a) The violations necessitating the stop placement or limited stop placement have been corrected; and (b) the provider exhibits the capacity to maintain correction of the violations previously found deficient. However, if upon the revisit the department finds new violations that the department reasonably believes will result in a new stop placement or new limited stop placement, the previous stop placement or limited stop placement shall remain in effect until the new stop placement or new limited stop placement is imposed.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) After a department finding of a violation for which a stop placement or limited stop placement has been imposed, the department shall make an on-site revisit of the provider within fifteen working days from the request for revisit, to ensure correction of the violation. For violations that are serious or recurring or uncorrected following a previous citation, and create actual or threatened harm to one or more residents' well-being, including violations of residents' rights, the department shall make an on-site revisit as soon as appropriate to ensure correction of the violation. Verification of correction of all other violations may be made by either a department on-site revisit or by written or photographic documentation found by the department to be credible. This subsection does not prevent the department from enforcing license suspensions or revocations. Nothing in this subsection shall interfere with or diminish the department's authority and duty to ensure that the provider adequately cares for residents, including to make departmental on-site revisits as needed to ensure that the provider protects residents, and to enforce compliance with this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.20A.205'>43.20A.205</a> governs notice of a license denial, revocation, suspension, or modification.
