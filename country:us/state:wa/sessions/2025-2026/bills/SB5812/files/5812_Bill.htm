The state continues to see growing needs for everything from special education to equitable student supports in school districts across the state. The legislature further finds the current one percent property growth cap has damaged the ability of our schools to adequately educate Washington's children because population and inflation have exceeded one percent regularly over the past decade. The legislature further finds that because costs have exceeded the one percent cap for over a decade, it has damaged local government's ability to adequately invest in public safety, including the recruitment and retention of well-trained law enforcement officers, early intervention, and other strategies to intervene in behavioral health treatment.<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that school funding obligations require an adjustment to levy equalization methods to ensure equitable funding for our state's public schools. Increasing local flexibility requires the state to ensure equitable funding for historically underinvested areas of our state, including rural school districts, mitigating widening funding gaps between schools.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the legislature's intent to increase the levy authority for state and local property tax limits from one percent to three percent to ensure investments in public K-12 schools and public safety improving community resiliency.
