These laws and court rules emphasize the inherent power of courts to govern their own courtrooms, including the capacity and duty of courts to rule on cases to promote justice. This authority increases transparency in the criminal legal process and permits courts to respond to not only penal ramifications of a sentence, but also the loss of civil privileges that accompany a criminal conviction.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50'>69.50</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) In courts of limited jurisdiction, a person charged with violating RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.4011'>69.50.4011</a>(1) (b) or (c),  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.4013'>69.50.4013</a>,  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.4014'>69.50.4014</a>, or  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.41.030'>69.41.030</a>(2) (b) or (c) may seek dismissal of such charges after showing proof of either undergoing a certified substance use disorder or certified co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder assessment and enrolling in and successfully completing a court-approved treatment program. </div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The assessment must consider the person's criminal history and substance use history and must show the person has a substance use disorder which requires treatment.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The treatment program must be approved by the court in the jurisdiction in which the individual is charged.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2)(a) If the individual files, under seal, the assessment report and proof of successful completion of the recommended treatment program at or before the readiness hearing, the court shall dismiss the charge or charges without prejudice on its own motion if the court finds:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The assessment considered the individual's criminal history and substance use history and shows the person has a substance use disorder that requires treatment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The individual successfully completed the recommended treatment program through a court-approved and state certified treatment provider; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The interests of justice warrant dismissal.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) If the individual is also charged with nonpossession offenses filed under the same cause number and arising from the same course of conduct as the charge or charges of possession, the court may dismiss those other charges without prejudice unless the prosecutor objects.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) In dismissing the charge or charges, the court must set forth its reasons for dismissing the charge or charges in writing and on the record.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
