The plan included recommendations on improving the health status of Washingtonians, improving access and quality of care, containing health care cost growth, and planning for long-term care needs.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) In 2006, the legislature created the blue ribbon commission on health care costs and access. The commission was tasked with developing a five-year plan for substantially improving access to affordable health care for all Washington residents. In 2007, the legislature enacted several recommendations from the commission including directing the office of financial management to develop a statewide health resources strategy to establish statewide health planning policies and goals related to the availability of health care facilities and services, quality of care, and cost of care. Certificate of need determinations must be consistent with that strategy.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) In 2024, the legislature directed the department of health to conduct an analysis of the certificate of need program and report its findings and recommendations for statutory updates by June 30, 2025.
