For those who rely on a power wheelchair or other mobility device, any delay in repair is not only a quality of life issue, but it can interfere with their employment, schooling, health, and safety. A recent survey of wheelchair users found that a majority of respondents had repair times that were at least four weeks, but often seven or more weeks. Therefore, the legislature intends to require mobility device manufacturers to make documentation, parts, embedded software, firmware, and tools available to independent repair providers and mobility device owners to ensure that there are more repair options available for Washingtonians, so no one has to wait for long repairs for vital equipment.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Authorized repair provider" means an individual or business that is unaffiliated with an original equipment manufacturer and that has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer to use the original equipment manufacturer's trade name, service mark, or other proprietary identifier for the purpose of offering the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of equipment under the name of the original equipment manufacturer, or that has an arrangement with the original equipment manufacturer under which the individual or business offers the services of diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of equipment on behalf of the original equipment manufacturer.
