This will help tourism-dependent small businesses across the state, while honoring our state's commitment to environmental progress and helping Washingtonians travel and connect without driving. Increased passenger-only ferry service will also support workforce development, by creating a workforce pipeline of hard-working mariners who can upgrade their licenses to take on larger vessels, including Washington state ferries and private sector opportunities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature, therefore, finds that additional passenger-only ferry service is necessary in order to improve the lives of all Washingtonians, while also honoring Washington's maritime heritage and the original mosquito fleet that helped build the Washington we love.Â </div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.57A.222'>36.57A.222</a> and 2015 3rd sp.s. c 44 s 313 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A governing body of a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">county under Title <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36'>36</a> RCW, a port district under Title <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=53'>53</a> RCW, a</span> public transportation benefit area((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">, located in a county that only borders the western side of Puget Sound with a population of more than two hundred thousand and contains one or more Washington state ferries terminals</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.57A'>36.57A</a> RCW, a city transit system under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.58.2721'>35.58.2721</a>, a county transportation authority under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.57'>36.57</a> RCW, a metropolitan municipal corporation transit system under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.56'>36.56</a> RCW, an unincorporated transportation benefit area under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.57.100'>36.57.100</a>, or a regional transit authority under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=81.112'>81.112</a> RCW, that borders or contains a navigable body of water</span>, may establish one or more passenger-only ferry service districts within all or a portion of the boundaries of the ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">public transportation benefit area</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">entity</span> establishing the passenger-only ferry service district.
