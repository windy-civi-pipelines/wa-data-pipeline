Furthermore, special education is fully part of the state's statutory program of basic education that is deemed by the legislature to implement Article IX, section 1 of the state Constitution.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature recognizes that a cap or enrollment limit on the number of students receiving special education services that generate state special education funding is not consistent with the state's duty to provide a free appropriate public education. An enrollment limit that fails to provide equity for all students with disabilities affects all students in public schools.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature recognizes that it has made significant investments in special education funding in recent years, including increasing the special education enrollment cap and increases to the funding multipliers.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature finds that even with the previous investments in special education funding, school districts' expenses to provide services often far exceed state funding, creating an inequitable situation for school districts and students. The legislature supports a system of funding that does not require school districts to generate local funding to meet their obligation to provide special education services.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further finds that along with reliable and sufficient state funding, receiving special education services in the least restrictive environment possible is crucial to student success. A recent large scale study found that students who spend at least 80 percent of their day in a general education setting improved their reading scores by 24 points and math scores by 18 points compared to peers with similar disabilities in less inclusive settings.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature, therefore, intends to continue making progress towards fully funding special education services by eliminating the cap entirely, lowering the threshold to access special education safety net funds, and increasing the tiered special education multipliers, thereby giving every school district a funding increase.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further intends to strengthen statewide efforts to support inclusion, monitor and reduce disproportionality, and support school districts in implementing a program of special education that meets the needs of students and families across the state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.150.390'>28A.150.390</a> and 2024 c 229 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The superintendent of public instruction shall submit to each regular session of the legislature during an odd-numbered year a programmed budget request for special education programs for students with disabilities.
