This framework is essential for maintaining a vibrant and sustainable cannabis marketplace that serves all Washingtonians. However, oversupply issues have arisen from the issuance of excessive cannabis producer licenses, creating uncertainty in the market. Suspending inactive cannabis producer licenses until an interstate or federal cannabis marketplace is established will address this challenge and promote stability.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.331'>69.50.331</a> and 2023 c 220 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) For the purpose of considering any application for a license to produce, process, research, transport, or deliver cannabis, useable cannabis, cannabis concentrates, or cannabis-infused products subject to the regulations established under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.385'>69.50.385</a>, or sell cannabis, or for the renewal of a license to produce, process, research, transport, or deliver cannabis, useable cannabis, cannabis concentrates, or cannabis-infused products subject to the regulations established under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.385'>69.50.385</a>, or sell cannabis, the board must conduct a comprehensive, fair, and impartial evaluation of the applications timely received.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The board may cause an inspection of the premises to be made, and may inquire into all matters in connection with the construction and operation of the premises.

"Chronic illegal activity" means (a) a pervasive pattern of activity that threatens the public health, safety, and welfare of the city, town, or county including, but not limited to, open container violations, assaults, disturbances, disorderly conduct, or other criminal law violations, or as documented in crime statistics, police reports, emergency medical response data, calls for service, field data, or similar records of a law enforcement agency for the city, town, county, or any other municipal corporation or any state agency; or (b) an unreasonably high number of citations for violations of RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.61.502'>46.61.502</a> associated with the applicant's or licensee's operation of any licensed premises as indicated by the reported statements given to law enforcement upon arrest.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) The board may not issue a cannabis retail license for any premises not currently licensed if:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The board receives a written objection from the legislative authority of an incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, relating to the physical location of the proposed premises;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The objection to the location from the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, is received by the board within 20 days of the board notifying the incorporated city or town, or county legislative authority, of the proposed cannabis retail location; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The objection to the issuance of a cannabis retail license at the specified location is based on a preexisting local ordinance limiting outlet density in a specific geographic area. For purposes of this subsection (11), a preexisting local ordinance is an ordinance enacted and in effect before the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed. No objection related to the physical location of a proposed premises may be made by a local government under this subsection (11) based on a local ordinance enacted after the date the applicant submits an application for a cannabis retail license to the board identifying the premises proposed to be licensed.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) After January 1, 2024, all cannabis licensees are encouraged but are not required to submit a social equity plan to the board. Upon confirmation by the board that a cannabis licensee who is not a social equity applicant, and who does not hold a social equity license issued under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=69.50.335'>69.50.335</a>, has submitted a social equity plan, the board must within 30 days reimburse such a licensee an amount equal to the cost of the licensee's annual cannabis license renewal fee. The license renewal fee reimbursement authorized under this subsection is subject to the following limitations:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The board may provide reimbursement one time only to any licensed entity; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Any licensed entity holding more than one cannabis license is eligible for reimbursement of the license renewal fee on only one license.<!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
