The request for qualifications documents shall include:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) A description of the project including the estimated design-build contract value and the intended use of the project;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The reasons for using the design-build procedure;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A description of the qualifications to be required of the proposer;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) A description of the process the public body will use to evaluate qualifications and finalists' proposals, including evaluation factors and the relative weight of factors and any specific forms to be used by the proposers;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Evaluation factors for qualifications shall include technical qualifications, such as specialized experience and technical competence of the firms and the key design and construction personnel; capacity to perform; the proposer's past performance in utilization of business entities certified with the office of minority and women's business enterprises, including small businesses and business entities certified with the department of veterans affairs, to the extent permitted by law; ability to provide a performance and payment bond for the project; and other appropriate factors.

The process may not proceed to the next phase until two business days after all proposers are notified of the committee's selection decision. At the request of a proposer not selected as a finalist, the public body must provide the requesting proposer with a scoring summary of the evaluation factors for its proposal. Proposers filing a protest on the selection of the finalists must file the protest in accordance with the published protest procedures. The selection process may not advance to the next phase of selection until two business days after the final protest decision is transmitted to the protestor.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Upon selection of the finalists, the public body shall issue a request for proposals to the finalists.
