The legislature intends to treat all municipal solid waste management systems equally throughout the state under the Washington cap and invest program. This act achieves equal treatment of all communities with municipal solid waste management systems under the Washington cap and invest program by adding a narrow program exemption for the state's only waste to energy municipal solid waste management system.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.65.080'>70A.65.080</a> and 2024 c 352 s 4 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A person is a covered entity as of the beginning of the first compliance period and all subsequent compliance periods if the person reported emissions under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15.2200'>70A.15.2200</a> for any calendar year from 2015 through 2019, or if additional data provided as required by this chapter indicates that emissions for any calendar year from 2015 through 2019 equaled or exceeded any of the following thresholds, or if the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer and imports electricity into the state during the compliance period:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Where the person owns or operates a facility and the facility's emissions equal or exceed 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Where the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer and generates electricity in the state and emissions associated with this generation equals or exceeds 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c)(i) Where the person is a first jurisdictional deliverer importing electricity into the state and:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(A) For specified sources, the cumulative annual total of emissions associated with the imported electricity exceeds 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(B) For unspecified sources, the cumulative annual total of emissions associated with the imported electricity exceeds 0 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent;
