It is the intent of this act to support educational opportunities that affirm the identity, history, and contributions of American Indian and Alaska Native communities while fostering academic achievement.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature acknowledges that it has intended to promote the full success of the centennial accord, signed by state and tribal government leaders in 1989, and the subsequent millennial accord in 1999. The legislature further recognizes that American Indian and Alaska Native students thrive in educational environments that honor their cultural heritage and provide meaningful connections to their land, language, and traditions. These connections are vital to building resilience, fostering a sense of belonging, and ensuring the success of future generations.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature further recognizes that American Indian and Alaska Native students have historically been misidentified and underidentified as a result of federal policies that fail to count American Indian and Alaska Native students who have more than one racial identity. This underidentification is persistent in educational systems for support services, academic opportunities, and cultural programs, and stems from a complex history that includes the forced removal of indigenous cultures, languages, and identities through policies and practices that sought to assimilate Native peoples.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to enact a state grant program to match the federal investment through the Title VI, Part A, Subpart 1 grant, which provides critical funding to school districts to meet the unique cultural, language, and educational needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students. This grant program aims to empower American Indian and Alaska Native students by supporting culturally relevant programming, enhancing access to resources, and strengthening partnerships between schools and tribal communities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Through this act, the legislature reaffirms its commitment to addressing educational inequities and honoring the sovereignty, identity, and future of American Indian and Alaska Native people in Washington state.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.300'>28A.300</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The office of native education created in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.300.105'>28A.300.105</a> shall administer a state matching grant program to support school districts and state-tribal education compact schools established under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.715'>28A.715</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of the superintendent of public instruction shall award state grants to school districts and state-tribal education compact schools that were eligible for and received funding from the federal Indian education formula grant under Title VI, Part A of the every student succeeds act (P.L. 114-95), in the prior school year.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) To receive a state grant, an eligible school district or state-tribal education compact school must submit a strategic plan to the office of native education for meeting the specific needs of American Indian and Alaska Native students.
