Nursing is the largest health care profession in the United States, yet rural hospitals, affiliated clinics, and underserved rural communities are experiencing a shortage of skilled registered nurses, including nurse practitioners who begin their careers as registered nurses, making it even more difficult to meet the health care needs of rural and underserved populations.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds the major barriers that rural nursing students face are lack of access to affordable child care, lack of transportation and safe and extended commute times, and lack of access to internet services and computers. The added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, subsequent reports of staff burnout, nurses leaving the profession, and higher salaries in urban areas has made it difficult for rural health care facilities, such as the state's 39 critical access hospitals, to compete with larger hospital systems in attracting and retaining a qualified workforce. Nurses living and working in rural communities are in short supply and high demand. Rural hospitals rely heavily on a substitute workforce such as traveling nurses, which is costly, unsustainable, and has significant recruitment and retention challenges.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature recognizes the rural nursing education program, a statewide program created in 2023 by a collaboration of health care stakeholders, addresses the concerns of the rural nursing workforce. The program fosters community-based collaborations between academic institutions, students, and rural community health care partners and has developed a remote grow-your-own nursing education plan that educates prelicensure students as registered nurses who want to learn, live, and work in their rural communities as registered nurses. The program plans to initially offer associate degree prelicensure education with the addition of future programs when resources are available. The legislature intends to codify the program as the rural nursing education program to create a future where underserved rural communities are fully staffed with qualified nurses and thrive with robust health care services staffed by local talent.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout sections 3 and 4 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Institution of higher education" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28B.10.016'>28B.10.016</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Nurse" or "nursing" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.79.020'>18.79.020</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Participant" means a student at a participating institution of higher education who is admitted into the program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Participating hospital" means a rural hospital licensed under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.41'>70.41</a> RCW that is participating in the rural nursing education program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Program" means the rural nursing education program established under section 3 of this act.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Rural" means a geographic area that has a shortage of nursing health services, as determined by the department.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) "Rural nursing education" means education and training programs with access to distance nursing education and training opportunities designed to prepare students for initial licensure as registered nurses, provided or developed in collaboration with an institution of higher education and rural community partners.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The rural nursing education program is established within the department to provide distance nursing education, sustain lasting change in rural health care nursing education, and improve quality nursing care for underserved rural populations across the state.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) In administering the program, the department shall:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Develop participant selection criteria, including the requirement that an eligible participant:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Is eligible to enroll in a nursing education or training program; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) Has declared an intention to serve in a rural area upon completion of the participant's nursing education or training program;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Develop a program application in collaboration with rural health care community partners, rural hospitals, and participating institutions of higher education;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Collaborate with rural health care community partners, including academic partners, local workforce development councils, the Washington state board of nursing, the Washington state hospital association, and exclusive bargaining representatives of nursing professions in the development of a remote rural nursing education program to connect participants, institutions of higher education, and community partners.
