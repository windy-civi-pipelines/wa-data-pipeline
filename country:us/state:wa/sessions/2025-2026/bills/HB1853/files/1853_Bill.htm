The task force produced recommendations to improve youth health through increased outdoor recreation and physical activities. One of the primary recommendations of the task report was to improve school, youth, and community use of school properties by designating them as community hubs and increasing their use through shared-use agreements.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature finds that access to green spaces has dramatic positive consequences for children and communities, including improvements in academic achievement, increased social connections, more opportunities for physical activity, and better overall health. The legislature also finds that: Public health research shows that the average school-age child spends less than 10 minutes in unstructured play outside each day; statewide only 25 percent of children get the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity; and physical inactivity is even more prevalent for girls, youth of color, youth from low-income families, youth with disabilities, and those who have immigrated to the United States.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature also acknowledges that in many areas of Washington, no undeveloped land is available for new parks. The fact that school districts already own property means that outdoor recreational opportunities can be greatly enhanced without costly land acquisition. School properties, if renovated based on school, neighborhood, and community input, have enormous potential to become daily and year-round community assets that support outdoor learning and community gathering and benefit the mental, emotional, and physical health of the youth and adults who live near them, especially those with the least access to play and physical activity opportunities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature also finds that improving schoolyards by adding green and natural features is a climate resiliency strategy with significant environmental and economic benefits. Schoolyards with more trees and vegetation and fewer concrete surfaces lower average ambient temperatures on warm days and improve air pollution year-round and schoolyards with rainwater capture reduce runoff. Green schoolyards can also increase residential property values and improve health outcomes, reducing health care costs.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">The legislature recognizes that community access to school properties is an essential component of a community's cohesion and active public spaces can make communities safer. Therefore, the legislature intends to strengthen community-shared or joint-use agreements between school districts, local governments, and nonprofit organizations in order for youth and communities to reap the benefits of green community schoolyards.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.620'>28A.620</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) It is the goal of the state of Washington to increase the use of outdoor recreational property owned by school districts for school, neighborhood, and community recreational purposes. Community schoolyards are valuable assets that have the potential to benefit students, families, and their surrounding communities including local residents and businesses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) All public school outdoor recreational spaces shall be designated as green community schoolyards and shall be available for general recreational purposes outside of school hours for public and community use, as authorized by school districts.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) School districts are encouraged to open their schoolyard, playground, and other recreational areas to community use outside of school hours for both structured and official use by community nonprofits or other entities, such as recreational sports leagues or after-school programs, and for unstructured free community play. Local school boards are urged to adopt policies allowing for robust community shared-use agreements with local government entities, community groups, and nonprofit organizations that promote recreational activity.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The office of the superintendent of public instruction shall, in consultation with the recreation and conservation office, school districts, educational associations, and youth and outdoor recreational organizations, adopt a model community shared-use policy to enable improved community use of playgrounds and playfields. The model policy must address:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Maximizing the use of school district recreational spaces for community use;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Costs associated with shared use;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Logistics of scheduling;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Liability protection;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Fee collection; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Sliding scale options and other strategies to address equity and other aspects of shared-use agreements.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) A school district that receives funding for green community schoolyards capital improvements must allow use of the improved school property through a community shared-use agreement consistent with the purposes of this section. School districts that adopt the model community shared-use policy shall be eligible for adjustments in the calculated rate of state funding assistance through the school construction assistance program. Additional points in the calculated rate shall be given to school districts that adopt the model policy.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 3.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.525.162'>28A.525.162</a> and 2013 2nd sp.s. c 18 s 513 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Funds appropriated to the superintendent of public instruction from the common school construction fund shall be allotted by the superintendent of public instruction in accordance with this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) No allotment shall be made to a school district until such district has provided local funds equal to or greater than the difference between the total approved project cost and the amount of state funding assistance to the district for financing the project computed pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=28A.525.166'>28A.525.166</a>, with the following exceptions:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The superintendent of public instruction may waive the local requirement for state funding assistance for districts which have provided funds for school building construction purposes through the authorization of bonds or through the authorization of excess tax levies or both in an amount equivalent to two and one-half percent of the value of its taxable property, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=39.36.015'>39.36.015</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) No such local funds shall be required as a condition to the allotment of funds from the state for the purpose of making major or minor structural changes to existing school facilities in order to bring such facilities into compliance with the barrier free access requirements of section 504 of the federal rehabilitation act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.
