Bigleaf maple syrup has a unique and desirable flavor profile that reflects the nuances of the trees' environment. On average, between 60 and 90 gallons of bigleaf maple sap are required to make one gallon of bigleaf maple syrup.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature further finds that it is impractical to use a commercial kitchen to process maple syrup. The high volume of sap needed as an input makes it impractical to transport the sap for processing, and the large quantity of steam produced during syrup production can be problematic in a nonspecialized kitchen. For these reasons, maple syrup production is typically done in an on-site, specialized facility known as a sugar shack.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature further finds that much of Washington's forestland well-suited to commercial sugaring is located in remote areas that lack utilities such as water, sewer, septic, and electrical systems and are not well-suited to the requirements of the food processor license.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature further finds that the United States food and drug administration considers the process of making maple syrup to be low risk. Maple syrup must be extensively boiled and is bottled at temperatures between 180 and 200 degrees, inherently controlling foodborne pathogens.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) It is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to create a maple syrup processing license that responds to maple syrup's unique production circumstances, supports the production of this unique regional commodity, and provides an economic incentive for leaving land forested.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span><span style="text-indent:0.5in;">The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) "Department" means the department of agriculture.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Director" means the director of the department.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Maple sap" means the sap or sweet water obtained by tapping a maple tree.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Maple syrup" means syrup made exclusively by the evaporation of pure maple sap.
