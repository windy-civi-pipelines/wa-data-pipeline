Rangeland and forest fires have grown both larger and more damaging in recent years, threatening the health, livelihoods, and homes of Washingtonians. Over the last 10 years, wildfires have burned an average of 470,000 acres across the state. According to the 2020 forest health assessment and treatment framework, approximately 3,000,000 acres in eastern Washington alone are in need of active management or disturbance to improve forest resiliency to stressors such as wildfire and drought.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature finds that prescribed fire and cultural burning are one of the most effective, yet underutilized tools to help address the forest health crisis. Most ecosystems in Washington evolved with fire through stewardship by tribal peoples and ignitions like lightning strikes. Prescribed fire and cultural burning remove dead and downed brush and vegetation near the forest floor, providing more management opportunities for fire suppression by proactively removing hazardous fuels. Compared to wildfire smoke, prescribed fire smoke produces up to 50 percent less PM2.5. Fire also returns important nutrients to the soil, revitalizes plant growth, and improves wildlife habitat. Tribes have used cultural burning since time immemorial to sustain healthy and resilient forests and grasslands.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The legislature finds that growing risks of wildfires to communities and the environment generally requires at least a five-fold increase in prescribed burning to effectively reduce accumulated fuels, restore resiliency to landscapes, and protect communities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The legislature further finds that while prescribed fire escapements are rare, the uncertain financial implications associated with an escapement deter this work despite its low risk. The 2023 Washington prescribed fire barriers assessment report and strategic action plan found that one of the most significant barriers to more prescribed burns has been uncertainty around potential liability.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a fire claims fund pilot program to provide loss coverage for prescribed and cultural burns conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. By decreasing the uncertainty associated with these regulated burns, the legislature intends to promote the use of this critical tool for strengthening and protecting our resources and communities.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.04'>76.04</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the office of risk management shall, in consultation with the department, establish a prescribed fire claims fund pilot program for the purposes of:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Supporting coverage for losses from prescribed fires and cultural burning by nonpublic entities such as cultural fire practitioners, private landowners, nongovernmental entities, certified burn managers, companies, contractors, and operators; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Supporting the entities described in (a) of this subsection that are alleged to have caused damages resulting from appropriately conducted prescribed fires or cultural burning.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) To be eligible for reimbursement under this section, a claim must meet the criteria in (a) and (b) of this subsection.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The claim results from a prescribed fire or cultural burn conducted:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) By a certified burn manager, under an approved burn plan, with applicable permits and in accordance with any other applicable conditions or requirements as determined by the department; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) By a cultural fire practitioner, in accordance with any applicable burn plan or permit.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The claim is for:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) Property or economic damage, as described under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.04.760'>76.04.760</a>(3) (a), (c), and (d), suffered by the claimant as a result of the prescribed fire or cultural burn; or</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) If the claimant is the department, reasonable costs incurred by the department in taking suppression action, or for payments authorized by the department under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=76.04.475'>76.04.475</a>, related to the prescribed fire or cultural burn.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) A claim for damage suffered as a result of a prescribed fire or cultural burn started, spread, or otherwise caused by a criminal or negligent act is not eligible for reimbursement under this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) Upon submission of a claim, the department shall determine and certify to the office of risk management whether the claim meets the criteria in subsection (2) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) The office of risk management may reimburse an eligible claim in an amount equal to or less than the actual losses suffered by the claimant, not to exceed $2,000,000 per claim.
