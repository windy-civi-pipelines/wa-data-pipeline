Residential battery energy storage systems will be a key part of the solution, but they must be connected to the grid and dispatchable by utilities during peak load events, and available to customers in the case of power outages. The initial cost of residential battery energy storage systems is a barrier for many light and power business customers. With a targeted incentive program, the state can aid utilities and their customers in the adoption of these systems with the goal of reducing costly transmission and distribution of capital expenditures; maximizing system benefits for all retail electric customers; and identifying opportunities for improving access to transformative technologies for low-income and moderate-income customers. Such incentive programs would help achieve clean energy transformation act goals.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.16'>82.16</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout this section and sections 3 through 6 of this act unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Distributed energy resource" has the same meaning as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.020'>19.405.020</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Low-income" has the same definition as in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=19.405.020'>19.405.020</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Moderate-income household" means a single person, family, or unrelated persons living together whose adjusted income is more than 80 percent but is at or below 115 percent of the median family income adjusted for family size, for the county, city, or metropolitan statistical area, where the project is located, as reported by the United States department of housing and urban development.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Qualified light and power business" means a light and power business as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.16.010'>82.16.010</a> that has a battery incentive program as described in section 3 of this act that is approved by the Washington State University extension energy program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Qualified light and power business customer" means a residential customer, nonprofit organization, public entity, tribal government, or academic institution.
