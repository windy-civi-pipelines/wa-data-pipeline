The employee may select the days on which the employee desires to take the two unpaid holidays after consultation with the employer pursuant to guidelines to be promulgated by rule of the appropriate personnel authority, or in the case of local government by ordinance or resolution of the legislative authority. If an employee prefers to take the two unpaid holidays on specific days for a reason of faith or conscience, or an organized activity conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination, church, or religious organization, the employer must allow the employee to do so unless the employee's absence would impose an undue hardship on the employer or the employee is necessary to maintain public safety.

Known as the 12s, Seattle seahawks fans are so loud and so present, that they feel like an extra player on the field. Since 1976, the 12s have packed out, first the kingdome and now lumen field, to support the hawks. Fiercely proud of their team and their city, the 12s set the tone and give the seahawks the determination and grit which they are known for around the league. On December 15, 1984, the seahawks became the first team in the league to retire a jersey number in honor of their fans. The number 12 now reserved forever for the fans.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->The 12s have become a legend in their own right, twice setting the guinness world record for loudest crowd noise at a sporting event. Following Marshawn Lynch's legendary run in the 2011 playoffs, the crowd noise registered on seismographs, going down in national football league lore as the beastquake. Opposing teams routinely practice with jet engine noise to prepare to play in Seattle, and the 12s even caused the national football league to try and institute an unsuccessful rule against excessive crowd noise.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">More than the thunder that they provide on the field, the 12s have helped build the bonds that bind the Washington community. Loyal to their team and community, for many 12s seahawks games simply mean home and their fellow 12s family. When fans wear the signature blue and green, they belong to the same team no matter where they live, what language they speak, or where they were born. The vibrant coalition of 12s demonstrates that people can make a big impact as a collective. The legislature intends the day of the 12s to be a celebration of the dedicated community that gathers across the globe each Sunday during football season to cheer on the Seattle seahawks. Go hawks.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
