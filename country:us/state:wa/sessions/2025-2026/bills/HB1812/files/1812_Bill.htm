This act is critical to protecting patient safety and preventing the disturbing trend of commercial health insurers imposing time caps or physical status caps for anesthesia during surgery, leading to dangerous practices that could jeopardize lives. This year, insurers have targeted some of the most vulnerable patients receiving anesthesia care including those under the age of one, those over the age of 70, those in emergency conditions, and those with severe systemic diseases or illnesses.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, the legislature intends to address the alarming potential for insurance companies to impose arbitrary time limits or slash reimbursements based on the duration of care or patient physical status, prioritizing profit over patient well-being. By mandating consistent and dependable access to medically necessary anesthesia services, the legislature intends to provide safeguards to protect patient-centered care and allow health care providers to deliver safe, high quality care without undue interference or financial coercion.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Because the legislature finds that immediate action is necessary to protect the ability of health care providers to deliver medically necessary health care services to Washingtonians, this act is deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, peace, and safety.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=48.43'>48.43</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) Health carriers for each health plan shall provide coverage for necessary anesthesia services for any procedure covered by the health plan, regardless of the duration of anesthesia care.
