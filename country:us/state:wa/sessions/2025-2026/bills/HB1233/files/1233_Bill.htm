It is also the intent of the legislature to ensure that the department, in developing and selecting correctional industries work programs, does not encourage the development of, or provide for selection of or contracting for, or the significant expansion of, any new or existing class I correctional industries work programs that unfairly compete with Washington businesses. The legislature intends that the requirements relating to fair competition in the correctional industries work programs be liberally construed by the department to protect Washington businesses from unfair competition. For purposes of establishing such a comprehensive program, the legislature recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work programs:(1) CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES.(a) The employer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed in total or in part by any profit or nonprofit organization pursuant to an agreement between the organization and the department. The organization shall produce goods or services for sale to both the public and private sector.(b) The customer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed by the department to provide Washington state manufacturers or businesses with products or services currently produced or provided by out-of-state or foreign suppliers.(c) The department shall review these proposed industries, including any potential new class I industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I industries work program, before the department contracts to provide such products or services. The review shall include the analysis required under RCW 72.09.115 to determine if the proposed correctional industries work program will compete with any Washington business. An agreement for a new class I correctional industries work program, or an agreement for a significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program, that unfairly competes with any Washington business is prohibited.(d) The department shall supply appropriate security and custody services without charge to the participating firms.(e) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage.(f) An ((inmate))incarcerated person who is employed in the class I program of correctional industries shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to any of the provisions of Title 50 RCW until released on parole or discharged.(2) CLASS II: TAX REDUCTION INDUSTRIES.(a) Industries in this class shall be state-owned and operated enterprises designed primarily to reduce the costs for goods and services for tax-supported agencies and for nonprofit organizations.(b)(i) The industries selected for development within this class shall, as much as possible, match the available pool of ((inmate))incarcerated person work skills and aptitudes with the work opportunities in the free community. The industries shall be closely patterned after private sector industries but with the objective of reducing public support costs rather than making a profit.(ii) Except as provided in RCW ((43.19.534(3)))39.26.251(2) and this section, the products and services of this industry, including purchased products and services necessary for a complete product line, may be sold to the following:(A) Public agencies;(B) Nonprofit organizations;(C) Private contractors when the goods purchased will be ultimately used by a public agency or a nonprofit organization;(D) An employee and immediate family members of an employee of the department;(E) A person under the supervision of the department and his or her immediate family members; and(F) A licensed health professional for the sole purpose of providing eyeglasses to enrollees of the state medical program at no more than the health professional's cost of acquisition.(iii) The department shall authorize the type and quantity of items that may be purchased and sold under (b)(ii)(D) and (E) of this subsection.(iv) It is prohibited to purchase any item purchased under (b)(ii)(D) and (E) of this subsection for the purpose of resale.(v) Clothing manufactured by an industry in this class may be donated to nonprofit organizations that provide clothing free of charge to low-income persons.(c) Under no circumstance shall ((offenders))incarcerated persons under the custody of the department of corrections make or assemble uniforms to be worn by correctional officers employed with the department.(d)(i) Class II correctional industries products and services shall be reviewed by the department before offering such products and services for sale to private contractors.(ii) The secretary shall conduct a yearly marketing review of the products and services offered under this subsection. Such review shall include an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed products and services on the Washington state business community. To avoid waste or spoilage and consequent loss to the state, when there is no public sector market for such goods, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold to private persons, at private sale. Surplus by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises that cannot be sold to public agencies or to private persons may be donated to nonprofit organizations. All sales of surplus products shall be carried out in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary.(e) Security and custody services shall be provided without charge by the department.(f) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons working in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall be paid for their work on a gratuity scale which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located and which is approved by the director of correctional industries, provided that the payment is no less than $1.00 per hour.(g) Provisions of RCW 41.06.142 shall not apply to contracts with Washington state businesses entered into by the department through class II industries.(3) CLASS III: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT INDUSTRIES.(a) Industries in this class shall be operated by the department. They shall be designed and managed to accomplish the following objectives:(i) Whenever possible, to provide basic work training and experience so that the ((inmate))incarcerated person will be able to qualify for better work both within correctional industries and the free community. It is not intended that an ((inmate's))incarcerated person's work within this class of industries should be his or her final and total work experience as an ((inmate))incarcerated person.(ii) Whenever possible, to provide forty hours of work or work training per week.(iii) Whenever possible, to offset tax and other public support costs.(b) Class III ((correctional)) industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews.

The scale shall be adopted))approved by the secretary of corrections, provided that the payment is no less than $1.00 per hour and the monthly maximum limit on such payment is no less than $200.(4) CLASS IV: COMMUNITY WORK INDUSTRIES.(a) Industries in this class shall be operated by the department. They shall be designed and managed to provide services in the ((inmate's))incarcerated person's resident community at a reduced cost. The services shall be provided to public agencies, to persons who are poor or infirm, or to nonprofit organizations.(b) Class IV ((correctional)) industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews. The department shall prepare quarterly detail statements showing where work crews worked, what ((correctional)) industry class, and the hours worked. Class IV ((correctional)) industries operated in work camps established pursuant to RCW 72.64.050 are exempt from the requirements of this subsection (4)(b).(c) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons in this program shall reside in facilities owned by, contracted for, or licensed by the department.

The purpose of this class of industries is to enable an ((inmate))incarcerated person, placed on community supervision, to work off all or part of a community restitution order as ordered by the sentencing court.(b) Employment shall be in a community restitution program operated by the state, local units of government, or a nonprofit agency.(c) To the extent that funds are specifically made available for such purposes, the department shall reimburse nonprofit agencies for workers compensation insurance costs.Sec. 4. RCW 72.09.130 and 1995 1st sp.s. c 19 s 6 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The department shall adopt, by rule, a system that clearly links an ((inmate's))incarcerated person's behavior and participation in available education and work programs with the receipt or denial of earned early release days and other privileges. The system shall include increases or decreases in the degree of liberty granted the ((inmate))incarcerated person within the programs operated by the department, access to or withholding of privileges available within correctional institutions, and recommended increases or decreases in the number of earned early release days that an ((inmate))incarcerated person can earn for good conduct and good performance, except that an incarcerated person's earned early release and other privileges may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.(2) Earned early release days shall be recommended by the department as a reward for accomplishment. The system shall be fair, measurable, and understandable to ((offenders))incarcerated persons, staff, and the public. At least once in each ((twelve))12-month period, the department shall inform the ((offender))incarcerated person in writing as to his or her conduct and performance. This written evaluation shall include reasons for awarding or not awarding recommended earned early release days for good conduct and good performance. An ((inmate))incarcerated person is not eligible to receive earned early release days during any time in which he or she refuses to participate in an available education ((or work)) program into which he or she has been placed under RCW 72.09.460. An incarcerated person's earned early release days may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.(3) The department shall provide each ((offender))incarcerated person in its custody a written description of the system created under this section.Sec. 5. RCW 72.09.460 and 2024 c 272 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate postsecondary degree or certificate opportunities to incarcerated individuals.(2) The legislature intends that all incarcerated individuals be required to participate in department-approved education programs, ((work programs, or both,)) unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education ((or work)) programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130; however, an incarcerated person's choice to not participate in a work program may not result in loss of privileges pursuant to section 6 of this act. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.(3) The legislature recognizes more incarcerated individuals may agree to participate in education and work programs than are available. The department must make every effort to achieve maximum public benefit by placing incarcerated individuals in available and appropriate education and work programs.(4)(a) The department shall, to the extent possible and considering all available funds, prioritize its resources to meet the following goals for incarcerated individuals in the order listed:(i) Achievement of basic academic skills through obtaining a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536, including achievement by those incarcerated individuals eligible for special education services pursuant to state or federal law;(ii) Achievement of vocational skills necessary for purposes of work programs and for an incarcerated individual to qualify for work upon release;(iii) Additional work and education programs necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270, including special education services and postsecondary degree or certificate education programs; and(iv) Other appropriate vocational, work, or education programs that are not necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270 including postsecondary degree or certificate education programs.(b)(i) If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department shall pay the cost of such programming, including but not limited to books, materials, and supplies for adult basic education programs and any postsecondary education program that is not financial aid eligible at the time the individual is enrolled or paid for by the department or third party.(ii) For financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department may require the individual to apply for any federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual as a condition of participation in such programming. The individual may elect to use available financial aid grants, self-pay, or any other available third-party funding, or use a combination of these methods to cover the cost of attendance for financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided under this subsection (4)(b)(ii). If an individual elects to self-pay or utilize third-party funding, the individual is not subject to the postaward formula described in (c) of this subsection. If the cost of attendance exceeds any financial grant awards that may be available to the individual, or the person is not eligible for federal or state financial aid grants, the department shall pay the cost of attendance not otherwise covered by third-party funding. All regulations and requirements set forth by the United States department of education for federal pell grants for prison education programs apply to financial aid eligible postsecondary programming.(c) If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, incarcerated individuals shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies. The individual may apply for and utilize federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual. If the individual is not eligible for federal financial aid grants, the individual may apply for and utilize state financial aid grants available to the individual. Department policies shall include a postaward formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay after deducting any amount from available financial aid or other available sources. The postaward formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary educational costs. Any postaward formula offsets and funds paid for by the department for educational programming shall not result in the reduction of any gift aid. The postaward formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs, may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an incarcerated individual. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.(d) All incarcerated individuals shall receive financial aid and academic advising from an accredited institution of higher education prior to enrollment in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program. Eligible individuals who choose not to participate or choose to cease participation in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program shall not result in a loss of privileges.(e) Correspondence courses are ineligible for state and federal financial aid funding.(f) The department may accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services from any third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of same to complete the purposes of this section.(g) Any funds collected by the department under (c) and (h) [(f)] of this subsection and subsections (11) and (12) of this section shall be used solely for the creation, maintenance, or expansion of incarcerated individual educational and vocational programs.(5) The department shall provide access to a program of education to all incarcerated individuals who are under the age of eighteen and who have not met high school graduation requirements or requirements to earn a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536 in accordance with chapter 28A.193 RCW. The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for incarcerated individuals under the age of eighteen must provide each incarcerated individual a choice of curriculum that will assist the incarcerated individual in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling. The curriculum may balance these and other rehabilitation, work, and training components.(6)(a) In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan and in placing incarcerated individuals in education and work programs:(i) An incarcerated individual's release date and custody level. An incarcerated individual shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that incarcerated individuals with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of incarcerated individuals participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;(ii) An incarcerated individual's education history and basic academic skills;(iii) An incarcerated individual's work history and vocational or work skills;(iv) An incarcerated individual's economic circumstances, including but not limited to an incarcerated individual's family support obligations; and(v) Where applicable, an incarcerated individual's prior performance in department-approved education or work programs;(b) The department shall establish, and periodically review, incarcerated individual behavior standards and program outcomes for all education and work programs. Incarcerated individuals shall be notified of applicable behavior standards and program goals prior to placement in an education or work program and shall be removed from the education or work program if they consistently fail to meet the standards or outcomes.(7) Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education ((or work)) programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.(8) The department shall establish, by rule, a process for identifying and assessing incarcerated individuals with learning disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other cognitive impairments to determine whether the person requires accommodations in order to effectively participate in educational programming, including general educational development tests and postsecondary education. The department shall establish a process to provide such accommodations to eligible incarcerated individuals.(9) The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color. The department may contract and partner with any accredited educational program sponsored by a nonprofit entity, community-based postsecondary education program, or institution with historical evidence of providing education programs to people of color.(10) The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an incarcerated individual is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled. The department shall periodically review the medical condition of all incarcerated individuals with temporary disabilities to ensure the earliest possible entry or reentry by incarcerated individuals into available programming.(11) The department shall establish policies requiring an incarcerated individual to pay all or a portion of the costs and tuition for any vocational training or postsecondary education program if the incarcerated individual previously abandoned coursework related to postsecondary degree or certificate education or vocational training without excuse as defined in rule by the department. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an incarcerated individual under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.(12) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an incarcerated individual subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227:(a) Shall not be required to participate in education programming except as may be necessary for the maintenance of discipline and security;(b) May not participate in a postsecondary degree education program offered by the department or its contracted providers, unless the incarcerated individual's participation in the program is paid for by a third party or by the individual;(c) May participate in prevocational or vocational training that may be necessary to participate in a work program;(d) Shall be subject to the requirements relating to incarcerated individual financial responsibility for programming under subsection (4) of this section.(13) If an incarcerated individual has participated in postsecondary education programs, the department shall provide the incarcerated individual with a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts, at no cost to the individual, upon the incarcerated individual's release or transfer to a different facility. Upon the incarcerated individual's completion of a postsecondary education program, the department shall provide to the incarcerated individual, at no cost to the individual, a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts. This requirement applies regardless of whether the incarcerated individual became ineligible to participate in or abandoned a postsecondary education program.(14) For the purposes of this section:(a) "Third party" includes a nonprofit entity or community-based postsecondary education program that partners with the department to provide accredited postsecondary education degree and certificate programs at state correctional facilities.(b) "Gift aid" has the meaning provided in RCW 28B.145.010.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 6. A new section is added to chapter 72.09 RCW to read as follows:Except when ordered by a court for community restitution, incarcerated persons are not required to work or otherwise participate in work programs under RCW 72.09.100. Work programs are voluntary, and incarcerated persons may choose to participate or refuse to participate in such programs. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department may not issue infractions or take any other punitive, disciplinary, or retaliatory actions against an incarcerated person in response to the person's choice to not participate in work programs. Incarcerated persons participating in class I, II, III, or IV programs must be paid a wage or gratuity for their work as provided under RCW 72.09.100.--- END ---

It is also the intent of the legislature to ensure that the department, in developing and selecting correctional industries work programs, does not encourage the development of, or provide for selection of or contracting for, or the significant expansion of, any new or existing class I correctional industries work programs that unfairly compete with Washington businesses. The legislature intends that the requirements relating to fair competition in the correctional industries work programs be liberally construed by the department to protect Washington businesses from unfair competition. For purposes of establishing such a comprehensive program, the legislature recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work programs:(1) CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES.(a) The employer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed in total or in part by any profit or nonprofit organization pursuant to an agreement between the organization and the department. The organization shall produce goods or services for sale to both the public and private sector.(b) The customer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed by the department to provide Washington state manufacturers or businesses with products or services currently produced or provided by out-of-state or foreign suppliers.(c) The department shall review these proposed industries, including any potential new class I industries work program or the significant expansion of an existing class I industries work program, before the department contracts to provide such products or services. The review shall include the analysis required under RCW 72.09.115 to determine if the proposed correctional industries work program will compete with any Washington business. An agreement for a new class I correctional industries work program, or an agreement for a significant expansion of an existing class I correctional industries work program, that unfairly competes with any Washington business is prohibited.(d) The department shall supply appropriate security and custody services without charge to the participating firms.(e) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage.(f) An ((inmate))incarcerated person who is employed in the class I program of correctional industries shall not be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to any of the provisions of Title 50 RCW until released on parole or discharged.(2) CLASS II: TAX REDUCTION INDUSTRIES.(a) Industries in this class shall be state-owned and operated enterprises designed primarily to reduce the costs for goods and services for tax-supported agencies and for nonprofit organizations.(b)(i) The industries selected for development within this class shall, as much as possible, match the available pool of ((inmate))incarcerated person work skills and aptitudes with the work opportunities in the free community. The industries shall be closely patterned after private sector industries but with the objective of reducing public support costs rather than making a profit.(ii) Except as provided in RCW ((43.19.534(3)))39.26.251(2) and this section, the products and services of this industry, including purchased products and services necessary for a complete product line, may be sold to the following:(A) Public agencies;(B) Nonprofit organizations;(C) Private contractors when the goods purchased will be ultimately used by a public agency or a nonprofit organization;(D) An employee and immediate family members of an employee of the department;(E) A person under the supervision of the department and his or her immediate family members; and(F) A licensed health professional for the sole purpose of providing eyeglasses to enrollees of the state medical program at no more than the health professional's cost of acquisition.(iii) The department shall authorize the type and quantity of items that may be purchased and sold under (b)(ii)(D) and (E) of this subsection.(iv) It is prohibited to purchase any item purchased under (b)(ii)(D) and (E) of this subsection for the purpose of resale.(v) Clothing manufactured by an industry in this class may be donated to nonprofit organizations that provide clothing free of charge to low-income persons.(c) Under no circumstance shall ((offenders))incarcerated persons under the custody of the department of corrections make or assemble uniforms to be worn by correctional officers employed with the department.(d)(i) Class II correctional industries products and services shall be reviewed by the department before offering such products and services for sale to private contractors.(ii) The secretary shall conduct a yearly marketing review of the products and services offered under this subsection. Such review shall include an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed products and services on the Washington state business community. To avoid waste or spoilage and consequent loss to the state, when there is no public sector market for such goods, by-products and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold to private persons, at private sale.

All sales of surplus products shall be carried out in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary.(e) Security and custody services shall be provided without charge by the department.(f) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons working in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall be paid for their work on a gratuity scale which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located and which is approved by the director of correctional industries, provided that the payment is no less than $1.00 per hour.(g) Provisions of RCW 41.06.142 shall not apply to contracts with Washington state businesses entered into by the department through class II industries.(3) CLASS III: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT INDUSTRIES.(a) Industries in this class shall be operated by the department. They shall be designed and managed to accomplish the following objectives:(i) Whenever possible, to provide basic work training and experience so that the ((inmate))incarcerated person will be able to qualify for better work both within correctional industries and the free community. It is not intended that an ((inmate's))incarcerated person's work within this class of industries should be his or her final and total work experience as an ((inmate))incarcerated person.(ii) Whenever possible, to provide forty hours of work or work training per week.(iii) Whenever possible, to offset tax and other public support costs.(b) Class III ((correctional)) industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews.

The services shall be provided to public agencies, to persons who are poor or infirm, or to nonprofit organizations.(b) Class IV ((correctional)) industries shall be reviewed by the department to set policy for work crews. The department shall prepare quarterly detail statements showing where work crews worked, what ((correctional)) industry class, and the hours worked. Class IV ((correctional)) industries operated in work camps established pursuant to RCW 72.64.050 are exempt from the requirements of this subsection (4)(b).(c) ((Inmates))Incarcerated persons in this program shall reside in facilities owned by, contracted for, or licensed by the department.

RCW 72.09.130 and 1995 1st sp.s. c 19 s 6 are each amended to read as follows:(1) The department shall adopt, by rule, a system that clearly links an ((inmate's))incarcerated person's behavior and participation in available education and work programs with the receipt or denial of earned early release days and other privileges. The system shall include increases or decreases in the degree of liberty granted the ((inmate))incarcerated person within the programs operated by the department, access to or withholding of privileges available within correctional institutions, and recommended increases or decreases in the number of earned early release days that an ((inmate))incarcerated person can earn for good conduct and good performance, except that an incarcerated person's earned early release and other privileges may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.(2) Earned early release days shall be recommended by the department as a reward for accomplishment. The system shall be fair, measurable, and understandable to ((offenders))incarcerated persons, staff, and the public. At least once in each ((twelve))12-month period, the department shall inform the ((offender))incarcerated person in writing as to his or her conduct and performance. This written evaluation shall include reasons for awarding or not awarding recommended earned early release days for good conduct and good performance. An ((inmate))incarcerated person is not eligible to receive earned early release days during any time in which he or she refuses to participate in an available education ((or work)) program into which he or she has been placed under RCW 72.09.460. An incarcerated person's earned early release days may not be reduced based on the person's choice to not participate in work programs.(3) The department shall provide each ((offender))incarcerated person in its custody a written description of the system created under this section.Sec. 5. RCW 72.09.460 and 2024 c 272 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:(1) Recognizing that there is a positive correlation between education opportunities and reduced recidivism, it is the intent of the legislature to offer appropriate postsecondary degree or certificate opportunities to incarcerated individuals.(2) The legislature intends that all incarcerated individuals be required to participate in department-approved education programs, ((work programs, or both,)) unless exempted as specifically provided in this section. Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education ((or work)) programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130; however, an incarcerated person's choice to not participate in a work program may not result in loss of privileges pursuant to section 6 of this act. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.(3) The legislature recognizes more incarcerated individuals may agree to participate in education and work programs than are available. The department must make every effort to achieve maximum public benefit by placing incarcerated individuals in available and appropriate education and work programs.(4)(a) The department shall, to the extent possible and considering all available funds, prioritize its resources to meet the following goals for incarcerated individuals in the order listed:(i) Achievement of basic academic skills through obtaining a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536, including achievement by those incarcerated individuals eligible for special education services pursuant to state or federal law;(ii) Achievement of vocational skills necessary for purposes of work programs and for an incarcerated individual to qualify for work upon release;(iii) Additional work and education programs necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270, including special education services and postsecondary degree or certificate education programs; and(iv) Other appropriate vocational, work, or education programs that are not necessary for compliance with an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan under RCW 72.09.270 including postsecondary degree or certificate education programs.(b)(i) If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department shall pay the cost of such programming, including but not limited to books, materials, and supplies for adult basic education programs and any postsecondary education program that is not financial aid eligible at the time the individual is enrolled or paid for by the department or third party.(ii) For financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided pursuant to (a)(i) through (iii) of this subsection, the department may require the individual to apply for any federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual as a condition of participation in such programming. The individual may elect to use available financial aid grants, self-pay, or any other available third-party funding, or use a combination of these methods to cover the cost of attendance for financial aid eligible postsecondary programming provided under this subsection (4)(b)(ii). If an individual elects to self-pay or utilize third-party funding, the individual is not subject to the postaward formula described in (c) of this subsection. If the cost of attendance exceeds any financial grant awards that may be available to the individual, or the person is not eligible for federal or state financial aid grants, the department shall pay the cost of attendance not otherwise covered by third-party funding. All regulations and requirements set forth by the United States department of education for federal pell grants for prison education programs apply to financial aid eligible postsecondary programming.(c) If programming is provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection, incarcerated individuals shall be required to pay all or a portion of the costs, including books, fees, and tuition, for participation in any vocational, work, or education program as provided in department policies. The individual may apply for and utilize federal and state financial aid grants available to the individual. If the individual is not eligible for federal financial aid grants, the individual may apply for and utilize state financial aid grants available to the individual. Department policies shall include a postaward formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay after deducting any amount from available financial aid or other available sources. The postaward formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary educational costs. Any postaward formula offsets and funds paid for by the department for educational programming shall not result in the reduction of any gift aid. The postaward formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities or community-based postsecondary education programs, may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any programming provided pursuant to (a)(iv) of this subsection on behalf of an incarcerated individual. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.(d) All incarcerated individuals shall receive financial aid and academic advising from an accredited institution of higher education prior to enrollment in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program. Eligible individuals who choose not to participate or choose to cease participation in a financial aid eligible postsecondary education program shall not result in a loss of privileges.(e) Correspondence courses are ineligible for state and federal financial aid funding.(f) The department may accept any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services from any third party, including but not limited to nonprofit entities and community-based postsecondary education programs, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of same to complete the purposes of this section.(g) Any funds collected by the department under (c) and (h) [(f)] of this subsection and subsections (11) and (12) of this section shall be used solely for the creation, maintenance, or expansion of incarcerated individual educational and vocational programs.(5) The department shall provide access to a program of education to all incarcerated individuals who are under the age of eighteen and who have not met high school graduation requirements or requirements to earn a high school equivalency certificate as provided in RCW 28B.50.536 in accordance with chapter 28A.193 RCW. The program of education established by the department and education provider under RCW 28A.193.020 for incarcerated individuals under the age of eighteen must provide each incarcerated individual a choice of curriculum that will assist the incarcerated individual in achieving a high school diploma or high school equivalency certificate. The program of education may include but not be limited to basic education, prevocational training, work ethic skills, conflict resolution counseling, substance abuse intervention, and anger management counseling. The curriculum may balance these and other rehabilitation, work, and training components.(6)(a) In addition to the policies set forth in this section, the department shall consider the following factors in establishing criteria for assessing the inclusion of education and work programs in an incarcerated individual's individual reentry plan and in placing incarcerated individuals in education and work programs:(i) An incarcerated individual's release date and custody level. An incarcerated individual shall not be precluded from participating in an education or work program solely on the basis of his or her release date, except that incarcerated individuals with a release date of more than one hundred twenty months in the future shall not comprise more than ten percent of incarcerated individuals participating in a new class I correctional industry not in existence on June 10, 2004;(ii) An incarcerated individual's education history and basic academic skills;(iii) An incarcerated individual's work history and vocational or work skills;(iv) An incarcerated individual's economic circumstances, including but not limited to an incarcerated individual's family support obligations; and(v) Where applicable, an incarcerated individual's prior performance in department-approved education or work programs;(b) The department shall establish, and periodically review, incarcerated individual behavior standards and program outcomes for all education and work programs. Incarcerated individuals shall be notified of applicable behavior standards and program goals prior to placement in an education or work program and shall be removed from the education or work program if they consistently fail to meet the standards or outcomes.(7) Eligible incarcerated individuals who refuse to participate in available education ((or work)) programs available at no charge to the incarcerated individuals shall lose privileges according to the system established under RCW 72.09.130. Eligible incarcerated individuals who are required to contribute financially to an education or work program and refuse to contribute shall be placed in another work program. Refusal to contribute shall not result in a loss of privileges.(8) The department shall establish, by rule, a process for identifying and assessing incarcerated individuals with learning disabilities, traumatic brain injuries, and other cognitive impairments to determine whether the person requires accommodations in order to effectively participate in educational programming, including general educational development tests and postsecondary education. The department shall establish a process to provide such accommodations to eligible incarcerated individuals.(9) The department shall establish, and periodically review, goals for expanding access to postsecondary degree and certificate education programs and program completion for all incarcerated individuals, including persons of color. The department may contract and partner with any accredited educational program sponsored by a nonprofit entity, community-based postsecondary education program, or institution with historical evidence of providing education programs to people of color.(10) The department shall establish, by rule, objective medical standards to determine when an incarcerated individual is physically or mentally unable to participate in available education or work programs. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is permanently unable to participate in any available education or work program due to a health condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement under subsection (2) of this section. When the department determines an incarcerated individual is temporarily unable to participate in an education or work program due to a medical condition, the incarcerated individual is exempt from the requirement of subsection (2) of this section for the period of time he or she is temporarily disabled. The department shall periodically review the medical condition of all incarcerated individuals with temporary disabilities to ensure the earliest possible entry or reentry by incarcerated individuals into available programming.(11) The department shall establish policies requiring an incarcerated individual to pay all or a portion of the costs and tuition for any vocational training or postsecondary education program if the incarcerated individual previously abandoned coursework related to postsecondary degree or certificate education or vocational training without excuse as defined in rule by the department. Department policies shall include a formula for determining how much an incarcerated individual shall be required to pay. The formula shall include steps which correlate to an incarcerated individual's average monthly income or average available balance in a personal savings account and which are correlated to a prorated portion or percent of the per credit fee for tuition, books, or other ancillary costs. The formula shall be reviewed every two years. A third party may pay directly to the department all or a portion of costs and tuition for any program on behalf of an incarcerated individual under this subsection. Such payments shall not be subject to any of the deductions as provided in this chapter.(12) Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, an incarcerated individual subject to the provisions of 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1227:(a) Shall not be required to participate in education programming except as may be necessary for the maintenance of discipline and security;(b) May not participate in a postsecondary degree education program offered by the department or its contracted providers, unless the incarcerated individual's participation in the program is paid for by a third party or by the individual;(c) May participate in prevocational or vocational training that may be necessary to participate in a work program;(d) Shall be subject to the requirements relating to incarcerated individual financial responsibility for programming under subsection (4) of this section.(13) If an incarcerated individual has participated in postsecondary education programs, the department shall provide the incarcerated individual with a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts, at no cost to the individual, upon the incarcerated individual's release or transfer to a different facility. Upon the incarcerated individual's completion of a postsecondary education program, the department shall provide to the incarcerated individual, at no cost to the individual, a copy of the incarcerated individual's unofficial transcripts. This requirement applies regardless of whether the incarcerated individual became ineligible to participate in or abandoned a postsecondary education program.(14) For the purposes of this section:(a) "Third party" includes a nonprofit entity or community-based postsecondary education program that partners with the department to provide accredited postsecondary education degree and certificate programs at state correctional facilities.(b) "Gift aid" has the meaning provided in RCW 28B.145.010.NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 6. A new section is added to chapter 72.09 RCW to read as follows:Except when ordered by a court for community restitution, incarcerated persons are not required to work or otherwise participate in work programs under RCW 72.09.100. Work programs are voluntary, and incarcerated persons may choose to participate or refuse to participate in such programs. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department may not issue infractions or take any other punitive, disciplinary, or retaliatory actions against an incarcerated person in response to the person's choice to not participate in work programs. Incarcerated persons participating in class I, II, III, or IV programs must be paid a wage or gratuity for their work as provided under RCW 72.09.100.--- END ---
