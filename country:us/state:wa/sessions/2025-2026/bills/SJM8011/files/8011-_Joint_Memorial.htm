The power of Congress to exercise this ministerial duty consists solely of the authority to name a reasonable time and place for the initial meeting of a convention.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Congress shall perform its ministerial duty of calling an amendment convention of the states only upon the receipt of applications for an amendment convention for the substantially same purpose as this application from two-thirds of the legislatures of the several states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Congress does not have the power or authority to determine any rules for the governing of an amendment convention of the states called pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution.

The power to name delegates remains exclusively within the authority of the legislatures of the several states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) By definition, an amendment convention of the states means that states must vote on the basis of one state, one vote.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) An amendment convention of the states convened pursuant to this application must be limited to consideration of the topics specified herein and no other. This application is made with the express understanding that an amendment that in any way seeks to amend, modify, or repeal any provision of the Bill of Rights shall not be authorized for consideration at any stage. This application is void ab initio if ever used at any stage to consider any change to any provision of the Bill of Rights.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, Congress may determine whether proposed amendments will be ratified by the legislatures of the several states or by special state ratification conventions. The legislature of the State of Washington recommends that Congress select ratification by the legislatures of the several states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) The legislature of the State of Washington may provide further instructions to its delegates and may recall its delegates at any time for a breach of a duty or a violation of the instructions provided.</div><div style="margin-top:4.5pt;text-indent:0.5in;">BE IT RESOLVED, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Donald J.
