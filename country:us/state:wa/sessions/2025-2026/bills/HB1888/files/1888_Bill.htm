The coronavirus pandemic added strain on an already overburdened health care system, further exposing the need to empower primary care providers to practice to the full scope of their training.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) In some areas, naturopathic physicians are the only available health care providers. As such, they need authority for all appropriate primary care services consistent with their education and patient populations. This act supports better patient care, prevents duplication of services, reduces emergency department visits, and is more cost-effective for patients, health plans, and state agencies.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) Naturopathic medical training emphasizes prevention and comprehensive primary care and includes the same basic and clinical science courses as would be taught in any conventional medical program in addition to behavioral health, counseling, and lifestyle medicine. Many patients seek care with naturopathic physicians in order to stop taking or lower their doses of prescription medications. Most controlled substances cannot be stopped without a careful dosage taper. Enabling naturopathic physicians to practice to the full extent of their training, to include authority to prescribe and deprescribe controlled substances, allows them to play a more significant role in addressing the ongoing opioid and benzodiazepine crises facing our communities.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) The legislature first granted naturopathic physicians limited prescriptive authority in 1987 and expanded this in 2005 to include all legend drugs and limited controlled substances in Schedules III through V of the uniform controlled substances act. Licensed naturopathic physicians in several states currently have prescriptive authority beyond what those in Washington have. Licensed naturopathic physicians have demonstrated competence and safety in prescribing controlled substances both here and in surrounding states.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) This act recognizes the board of naturopathy and its role in rule making for determination of specific clinical parameters and educational requirements in the same manner as other boards and commissions with primary care authority.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.36A.020'>18.36A.020</a> and 2021 c 179 s 2 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Board" means the board of naturopathy created in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.36A.150'>18.36A.150</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Colon hydrotherapist" means a person certified under this chapter to perform colon hydrotherapy pursuant to an affiliation with one or more naturopaths.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Colon hydrotherapy" means the performance of enemas or colonic irrigation.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Common diagnostic procedures" means the use of venipuncture consistent with the practice of naturopathic medicine, commonly used diagnostic modalities consistent with naturopathic practice, health history taking, physical examination, radiography, examination of body orifices excluding endoscopy, laboratory medicine, and obtaining samples of human tissues, but excluding incision or excision beyond that which is authorized as a minor office procedure.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Department" means the department of health.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Educational program" means an accredited program preparing persons for the practice of naturopathic medicine.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) "Homeopathy" means a system of medicine based on the use of infinitesimal doses of medicines capable of producing symptoms similar to those of the disease treated, as listed in the homeopathic pharmacopeia of the United States.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) "Hygiene and immunization" means the use of such preventative techniques as personal hygiene, asepsis, public health, and immunizations, to the extent allowed by rule.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) "Manual manipulation" or "mechanotherapy" means manipulation of a part or the whole of the body by hand or by mechanical means.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) "Minor office procedures" means care and procedures incident thereto of superficial lacerations, lesions, ((<span style="text-decoration:line-through;">and abrasions</span>))<span style="text-decoration:underline;">minor injuries</span>, and the removal of foreign bodies located in superficial structures, not to include the eye <span style="text-decoration:underline;">other than inspection and lavage</span>; and the use of antiseptics and topical or local anesthetics in connection therewith.
