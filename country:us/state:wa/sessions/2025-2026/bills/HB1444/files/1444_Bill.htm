"Rapid whole genome sequencing" includes patient-only whole genome sequencing, as well as duo and trio whole genome sequencing of the patient and the patient's biological parent or parents. "Rapid whole genome sequencing" includes any analysis, interpretation, and data report derived from such sequencing.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
