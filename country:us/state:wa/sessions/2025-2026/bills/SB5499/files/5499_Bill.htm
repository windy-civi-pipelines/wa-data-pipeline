The legislature finds that since March 2018, the department of corrections has been using body scanners to detect contraband, which has resulted in the confiscation of nearly 1,000 unique items, over 43 grams of controlled substances, and over $100 in currency. The legislature recognizes that without passage of legislation, funding and authorization for the body scanner program will discontinue. Therefore, the legislature resolves to continue existing practice of the body scanner program by codifying operational standards and requiring continued utilization of scanners in certain institutions of total confinement.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=72.09'>72.09</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1)(a) The department shall establish a comprehensive body scanner program at the Washington corrections center for women and at a state correctional facility serving male incarcerated individuals as part of a program to protect human dignity by reducing or eliminating strip searches and create drug-free state correctional facilities.
