The department of children, youth, and families shall coordinate with the department of corrections to transfer any person that makes a transfer request under this subsection. The department of corrections shall place individuals who voluntarily transfer to their custody under this subsection directly into any placement that is agreed to by the department of corrections without first placing the individual in a facility designed for classification.
