As such, students attending schools of cosmetology or natural hair styling may complete training programs without a full understanding of how to maintain, treat, and style a diverse range of hair textures including curly, coiled, coarse, and thick hair. This institutionalized gap in knowledge can result in harm to health and damage to the hair of clients from varying cultural and ethnic backgrounds.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to establish a process to empower cosmetologists with the skills and confidence to consult and work with clients with textured hair while maintaining the industry health and safety standards.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.16.020'>18.16.020</a> and 2015 c 62 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->As used in this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(1) "Apprentice" means a person who is engaged in a state-approved apprenticeship program and who must receive a wage or compensation while engaged in the program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) "Apprentice monthly report" means the apprentice record of daily activities and the number of hours completed in each course of a curriculum that is prepared monthly by the approved apprenticeship program and provided to the apprentice, audited annually by the department, and kept on file by the approved apprenticeship program for three years.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) "Apprentice trainer" means a person who gives training to an apprentice in an approved apprenticeship program and who is approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.16.280'>18.16.280</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(4) "Apprenticeship program" means a state-approved apprenticeship program pursuant to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.04'>49.04</a> RCW and approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.16.280'>18.16.280</a> for the training of cosmetology, hair design, barbering, esthetics, master esthetics, and manicuring.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(5) "Apprenticeship training committee" means a committee approved by the Washington apprenticeship and training council established in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.04'>49.04</a> RCW.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(6) "Approved apprenticeship shop" means a salon/shop that has been approved under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=18.16.280'>18.16.280</a> and chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.04'>49.04</a> RCW to participate in an apprenticeship program.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(7) "Approved security" means surety bond.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(8) "Barber" means a person licensed under this chapter to engage in the practice of barbering.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(9) "Board" means the cosmetology, hair design, barbering, esthetics, and manicuring advisory board.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(10) "Cosmetologist" means a person licensed under this chapter to engage in the practice of cosmetology.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(11) "Crossover training" means training approved by the director as training hours that may be credited to current licensees for similar training received in another profession licensed under this chapter.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(12) "Curriculum" means the courses of study taught at a school, online training by a school, in an approved apprenticeship program established by the Washington state apprenticeship and training council and conducted in an approved salon/shop, or online training by an approved apprenticeship program, set by rule under this chapter, and approved by the department.
