ï»¿H-0976.1HOUSE BILL 1752State of Washington69th Legislature2025 Regular SessionByRepresentatives Duerr, Parshley, and ReedRead first time 01/31/25.Referred to Committee on Early Learning & Human Services.AN ACT Relating to concurrent jurisdiction for courts of limited jurisdiction over juvenile misdemeanor offenses; reenacting and amending RCW 13.04.030; adding a new section to chapter 13.04 RCW; and creating a new section.BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:NEW SECTION.Â Â Sec. 1. The legislature finds that a quick response to alleged juvenile offenses may prevent further juvenile offenses and better serve the community. Given the large volume of cases heard in juvenile court, the legislature intends to provide greater flexibility in allowing courts of limited jurisdiction to have concurrent jurisdiction over less serious juvenile offenses. When courts of limited jurisdiction are capable of hearing these cases and respond more quickly, it will better serve the community to have this option.Sec. 2. RCW 13.04.030 and 2024 c 232 s 2 and 2024 c 117 s 3 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:(1) Except as provided in this section, the juvenile courts in this state shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings:(a) Under the interstate compact on placement of children as provided in chapter 26.34 RCW;(b) Relating to children alleged or found to be dependent as provided in chapter 26.44 RCW and in RCW 13.34.030 through 13.34.161;(c) Relating to the termination of a parent and child relationship as provided in RCW 13.34.180 through 13.34.210;(d) To approve or disapprove out-of-home placement as provided in RCW 13.32A.170;(e) Relating to juveniles alleged or found to have committed offenses, traffic or civil infractions, or violations as provided in RCW 13.40.020 through 13.40.230, unless:(i) The juvenile court transfers jurisdiction of a particular juvenile to adult criminal court pursuant to RCW 13.40.110;(ii) The statute of limitations applicable to adult prosecution for the offense, traffic or civil infraction, or violation has expired;(iii) The alleged offense or infraction is a traffic, fish, boating, or game offense, or traffic or civil infraction committed by a juvenile 16 years of age or older and would, if committed by an adult, be tried or heard in a court of limited jurisdiction, in which instance the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction over the alleged offense or infraction, and no guardian ad litem is required in any such proceeding due to the juvenile's age. If such an alleged offense or infraction and an alleged offense or infraction subject to juvenile court jurisdiction arise out of the same event or incident, the juvenile court may have jurisdiction of both matters. The jurisdiction under this subsection does not constitute "transfer" or a "decline" for purposes of RCW 13.40.110 (1) or (2) or (e)(i) of this subsection.

The juvenile court shall maintain residual juvenile court jurisdiction up to age 25 if the juvenile has turned 18 years of age during the adult criminal court proceedings but only for the purpose of returning a case to juvenile court for disposition pursuant to RCW 13.40.300(2)(a)(ii).(III) The prosecutor and respondent may agree to juvenile court jurisdiction and waive application of exclusive adult criminal jurisdiction in (e)(v)(A) through (C) of this subsection and remove the proceeding back to juvenile court with the court's approval.If the juvenile challenges the state's determination of the juvenile's criminal history under (e)(v) of this subsection, the state may establish the offender's criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence.
