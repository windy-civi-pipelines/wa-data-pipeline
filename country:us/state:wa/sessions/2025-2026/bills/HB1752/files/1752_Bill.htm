Given the large volume of cases heard in juvenile court, the legislature intends to provide greater flexibility in allowing courts of limited jurisdiction to have concurrent jurisdiction over less serious juvenile offenses. When courts of limited jurisdiction are capable of hearing these cases and respond more quickly, it will better serve the community to have this option.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.04.030'>13.04.030</a> and 2024 c 232 s 2 and 2024 c 117 s 3 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) Except as provided in this section, the juvenile courts in this state shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all proceedings:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Under the interstate compact on placement of children as provided in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.34'>26.34</a> RCW;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Relating to children alleged or found to be dependent as provided in chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.44'>26.44</a> RCW and in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.030'>13.34.030</a> through  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.161'>13.34.161</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Relating to the termination of a parent and child relationship as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.180'>13.34.180</a> through  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.210'>13.34.210</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) To approve or disapprove out-of-home placement as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.32A.170'>13.32A.170</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Relating to juveniles alleged or found to have committed offenses, traffic or civil infractions, or violations as provided in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.40.020'>13.40.020</a> through  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.40.230'>13.40.230</a>, unless:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(i) The juvenile court transfers jurisdiction of a particular juvenile to adult criminal court pursuant to RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.40.110'>13.40.110</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(ii) The statute of limitations applicable to adult prosecution for the offense, traffic or civil infraction, or violation has expired;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(iii) The alleged offense or infraction is a traffic, fish, boating, or game offense, or traffic or civil infraction committed by a juvenile 16 years of age or older and would, if committed by an adult, be tried or heard in a court of limited jurisdiction, in which instance the appropriate court of limited jurisdiction shall have jurisdiction over the alleged offense or infraction, and no guardian ad litem is required in any such proceeding due to the juvenile's age.
