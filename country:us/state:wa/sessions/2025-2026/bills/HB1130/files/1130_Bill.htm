Enrollment into and receipt of developmental disabilities administration home and community-based services and supports can prevent traumatic and expensive hospital stays and institutionalization as well as harm in communities leading to incarceration. The legislature recognizes that until the state can achieve a system capable of providing help as soon as help is needed for all individuals with developmental disabilities, it is imperative to strategically intervene at times of crisis so that populations for which intervention is most critical are served without delay. Therefore, the legislature intends to provide a clear prioritization of populations most in need for developmental disabilities services and supports.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NEW SECTION.</span><span>Â Â </span><span style="font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.10'>71A.10</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;"><!-- field: Text -->(1) When enrolling eligible clients in open home and community-based services waiver slots and for the purposes of determining access to specific waiver services, to the extent consistent with federal law and federal funding requirements, the administration shall prioritize clients in the following populations:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) Persons who are age 45 and older;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) Persons who, within the previous six months, have remained in a hospital without a safe discharge plan;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) Persons who meet the criteria outlined in RCWÂ  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.12.370'>71A.12.370</a>;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Persons who are discharging from institutional settings including residential habilitation centers and state hospitals;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Persons the administration has determined to be in immediate risk of admission to an intermediate care facility due to unmet health and welfare needs;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(f) Persons who have been found incompetent to stand trial in a criminal matter due to a developmental disability; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(g) Persons eligible for services under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71A.12.090'>71A.12.090</a>.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(2) The administration shall align its rules to provide for the prioritization for waiver slots and services for the populations identified in subsection (1) of this section.</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(3) The administration shall routinely collect data on the following items related to home and community-based services waivers and make the data publicly available on the administration's website:</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(a) The number of people enrolled in each waiver;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(b) The capacity and waitlist, if any, for each waiver, including the number of people from the prioritized populations identified in subsection (1) of this section who are on a waitlist for waiver enrollment;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(c) The number of people from the prioritized populations identified in subsection (1) of this section that have been enrolled on each waiver since the last report;</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(d) Any requests for waiver services that have not been fulfilled and the reason the request has not been fulfilled; and</div><div style="text-indent:0.5in;">(e) Any unfulfilled requests for waiver services from the prioritized populations identified in subsection (1) of this section, including the type of service and the reason the request has not been fulfilled.</div><!-- field: --><div style="margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">--- END ---</div></body></html>
